# AWS clients for Elixir

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir/actions)

## Features

* Generated by [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) using the
  same JSON descriptions of AWS services used to build the
  [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis).
* Support for most AWS services that use `json` and `rest-json` protocols.


## Installation

* Add `aws` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`. It also requires [hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) for the default HTTP client. Optionally, you can implement your own (Check AWS.Client docs).

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [
      {:aws, "~> 0.5.0"},
      {:hackney, "~> 1.16"}
    ]
  end
  ```

* Run `mix deps.get` to install.

## Usage

Listing Amazon Kinesis streams. Start a console with `iex -S mix`:

```elixir
iex> client = %AWS.Client{access_key_id: "<access-key-id>",
                     secret_access_key: "<secret-access-key>",
                     region: "us-east-1",
                     endpoint: "amazonaws.com"}

iex> {:ok, result, resp} = AWS.Kinesis.list_streams(client, %{})

iex> IO.inspect result
%{"HasMoreStreams" => false, "StreamNames" => []}
```

## Development

Most of the code is generated using the [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen)
library from the JSON descriptions of AWS services provided by Amazon. They can be found in `lib/aws/generated`.

Code outside `lib/aws/generated` is manually written and used as support for the generated code.
