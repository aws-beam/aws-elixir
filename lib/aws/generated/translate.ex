  Creates or updates a custom terminology, depending on whether or not one already
  exists for the given terminology name.

  Importing a terminology with the same name as an existing one will merge the
  terminologies based on the chosen merge strategy. Currently, the only supported
  merge strategy is OVERWRITE, and so the imported terminology will overwrite an
  existing terminology of the same name.

  If you import a terminology that overwrites an existing one, the new terminology
  take up to 10 minutes to fully propagate and be available for use in a
  translation due to cache policies with the DataPlane service that performs the
  translations.

  Starts an asynchronous batch translation job.

  Batch translation jobs can be used to translate large volumes of text across
  multiple documents at once. For more information, see `async`.

  Batch translation jobs can be described with the `DescribeTextTranslationJob`
  operation, listed with the `ListTextTranslationJobs` operation, and stopped with
  the `StopTextTranslationJob` operation.

  Amazon Translate does not support batch translation of multiple source languages
  at once.

  Stops an asynchronous batch translation job that is in progress.

  If the job's state is `IN_PROGRESS`, the job will be marked for termination and
  put into the `STOP_REQUESTED` state. If the job completes before it can be
  stopped, it is put into the `COMPLETED` state. Otherwise, the job is put into
  the `STOPPED` state.

  Asynchronous batch translation jobs are started with the
  `StartTextTranslationJob` operation. You can use the
  `DescribeTextTranslationJob` or `ListTextTranslationJobs` operations to get a
  batch translation job's `JobId`.
