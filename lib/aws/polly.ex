  Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting
  speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or
  female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice
  name.

  When synthesizing speech ( `SynthesizeSpeech` ), you provide the voice ID
  for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by
  `DescribeVoices`.

  For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a
  specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using
  the `DescribeVoices` operation you can provide the user with a list of
  available voices to select from.

  You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices.
  For example, if you specify `en-US`, the operation returns a list of all
  available US English voices.

  This operation requires permissions to perform the `polly:DescribeVoices`
  action.
