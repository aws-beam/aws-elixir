🌳 With this library you can have access to almost all AWS services without hassle. ⚡

## Features

* A clean API separated per service. Each module has a correspondent service.
* Support for most of AWS services.
* Configurable HTTP client and JSON parser.
* Generated by [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) using the
  same JSON descriptions of AWS services used to build the
  [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis).
* Documentation is updated from the official AWS docs.

## Usage

Here is an example of listing Amazon Kinesis streams. First you need to start a
console with `iex -S mix`.

After that, type the following:

```elixir
iex> client = AWS.Client.create("your-access-key-id", "your-secret-access-key", "us-east-1")
iex> {:ok, result, resp} = AWS.Kinesis.list_streams(client, %{})
iex> IO.inspect(result)
%{"HasMoreStreams" => false, "StreamNames" => []}
```

If you are using `AWS.S3`, you can upload a file with integrity check doing:

```elixir
iex> client = AWS.Client.create("your-access-key-id", "your-secret-access-key", "us-east-1")
iex> file = File.read!("./tmp/your-file.txt")
iex> md5 = :crypto.hash(:md5, file) |> Base.encode64()
iex> AWS.S3.put_object(client, "your-bucket-name", "foo/your-file-on-s3.txt",
  %{"Body" => file, "ContentMD5" => md5})
```

Note that you may need to specify the `ContentType` attribute when calling `AWS.S3.put_object/4`.
This is because S3 will use that to store the MIME type of the file.

You can also upload to S3 as multipart. If you're facing timeout issues, this strategy is
recommended.

```elixir
client = AWS.Client.create("your-access-key-id", "your-secret-access-key", "us-east-1")
bucket = "your-bucket-name"
filename = "./your-big-file.wav"
# AWS minimum chunk size is 5MB
chunk_size = 5_242_880

# Create the Multipart upload
{:ok,
 %{
   "InitiateMultipartUploadResult" => %{
     "UploadId" => upload_id
   }
 }, _} = AWS.S3.create_multipart_upload(client, bucket, filename, %{})

file = File.read!(filename)

# Send the file's binary in parts
parts =
  file
  |> String.codepoints()
  |> Stream.chunk_every(chunk_size)
  |> Stream.with_index(1)
  |> Enum.map(fn {chunk, i} ->
    chunk = Enum.join(chunk)

    {:ok, nil, %{headers: headers, status_code: 200}} =
      AWS.S3.upload_part(aws_client, bucket, filename, %{
        "Body" => chunk,
        "PartNumber" => i,
        "UploadId" => upload_id
      })

    {_, etag} = Enum.find(headers, fn {header, _} -> header == "ETag" end)

    %{"ETag" => etag, "PartNumber" => i}
  end)


input = %{"CompleteMultipartUpload" => %{"Part" => parts}, "UploadId" => upload_id}

# Complete the multipart request
AWS.S3.complete_multipart_upload(aws_client, bucket, filename, input)
```

You can also list objects in a bucket:

```elixir
# create the client just like the example above
iex> AWS.S3.list_objects_v2(client, "bucket-name-here")
```

And download a specific object:

```elixir
# create the client just like the example above
# object key is the "file path" in the S3 bucket
iex> AWS.S3.get_object(client, "bucket-name-here", "object-key-here")
```

Check all S3 related functions [in the docs here](https://hexdocs.pm/aws/AWS.S3.html).

Remember to check the operation documentation for details:
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)

## Installation

Add `:aws` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`. It also requires
[hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) for the default HTTP client.
Optionally, you can implement your own (Check `AWS.Client` docs).

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aws, "~> 0.13.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.18"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to install.

## Development

Most of the code is generated using the
[aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) library from the JSON
descriptions of AWS services provided by Amazon. They can be found in
`lib/aws/generated`.

Code outside `lib/aws/generated` is manually written and used as support for
the generated code.

## Documentation

Online
* [Hex Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/aws)

Local
* Run `mix docs`
* Open `docs/index.html`

__Note:__ Arguments, errors and response structure can be found by viewing the model schemas used to generate this module at `aws-sdk-go/models/apis/<aws-service>/<version>/`.

An example is [`aws-sdk-go/models/apis/rekognition/2016-06-27/api-2.json`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/models/apis/rekognition/2016-06-27/api-2.json).
Alternatively you can access the documentation for the service you want at [AWS docs page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

## Tests

```
$ mix test
```

## Release

* Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` is up-to-date and and reflects the changes for
  the new version.
* Bump the version here in the `README.md` and in `mix.exs`.
* Run `git tag v$VERSION` to tag the version that was just published.
* Run `git push --tags origin master` to push tags to Github.
* Run `mix hex.publish` to publish the new version.
