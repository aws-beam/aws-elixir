  AWS Import/Export Service

  AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data between the AWS
  cloud and portable storage devices that you mail to us.

  AWS Import/Export transfers data directly onto and off of your storage devices
  using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For large
  data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more
  cost effective than upgrading your connectivity.
