  Amazon Elastic File System

  Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file
  storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon
  EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as
  you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need,
  when they need it. For more information, see the [User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
  """

  @doc """
  Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation token
  in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure idempotent creation (calling
  the operation with same creation token has no effect). If a file system
  does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's AWS account with the
  specified creation token, this operation does the following:

  <ul> <li> Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an
  Amazon EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state `creating`.

  </li> <li> Returns with the description of the created file system.

  </li> </ul> Otherwise, this operation returns a `FileSystemAlreadyExists`
  error with the ID of the existing file system.

  <note> For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID for the
  creation token.

  </note> The idempotent operation allows you to retry a `CreateFileSystem`
  call without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when an
  initial call fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a file
  system was actually created. An example might be that a transport level
  timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use the same
  creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in creating a file
  system, the client can learn of its existence from the
  `FileSystemAlreadyExists` error.

  <note> The `CreateFileSystem` call returns while the file system's
  lifecycle state is still `creating`. You can check the file system creation
  status by calling the `DescribeFileSystems` operation, which among other
  things returns the file system state.

  </note> This operation also takes an optional `PerformanceMode` parameter
  that you choose for your file system. We recommend `generalPurpose`
  performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the `maxIO`
  performance mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and
  operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for most
  file operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file
  system has been created. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: Performance
  Modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes.html).

  After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets its lifecycle state
  to `available`, at which point you can create one or more mount targets for
  the file system in your VPC. For more information, see `CreateMountTarget`.
  You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 instances in your VPC by
  using the mount target. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it
  Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).

  This operation requires permissions for the
  `elasticfilesystem:CreateFileSystem` action.

  Creates a mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file
  system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.

  You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your VPC. All
  EC2 instances in a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a single
  mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple subnets in an
  Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the subnets. EC2
  instances do not need to be in the same subnet as the mount target in order
  to access their file system. For more information, see [Amazon EFS: How it
  Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html).

  In the request, you also specify a file system ID for which you are
  creating the mount target and the file system's lifecycle state must be
  `available`. For more information, see `DescribeFileSystems`.

  In the request, you also provide a subnet ID, which determines the
  following:

  <ul> <li> VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

  </li> <li> Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

  </li> <li> IP address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address of
  the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the request)

  </li> </ul> After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response
  that includes, a `MountTargetId` and an `IpAddress`. You use this IP
  address when mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use
  the mount target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The EC2 instance
  on which you mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve
  the mount target's DNS name to its IP address. For more information, see
  [How it Works: Implementation
  Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-implementation).

  Note that you can create mount targets for a file system in only one VPC,
  and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That is, if
  the file system already has one or more mount targets created for it, the
  subnet specified in the request to add another mount target must meet the
  following requirements:

  <ul> <li> Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount
  targets

  </li> <li> Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of the subnets
  of the existing mount targets

  </li> </ul> If the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the
  following:

  <ul> <li> Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.

  </li> <li> Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:

  <ul> <li> If the request provides an `IpAddress`, Amazon EFS assigns that
  IP address to the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a free
  address in the subnet (in the same way that the Amazon EC2
  `CreateNetworkInterface` call does when a request does not specify a
  primary private IP address).

  </li> <li> If the request provides `SecurityGroups`, this network interface
  is associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the
  default security group for the subnet's VPC.

  </li> <li> Assigns the description `Mount target *fsmt-id* for file system
  *fs-id* ` where ` *fsmt-id* ` is the mount target ID, and ` *fs-id* ` is
  the `FileSystemId`.

  </li> <li> Sets the `requesterManaged` property of the network interface to
  `true`, and the `requesterId` value to `EFS`.

  </li> </ul> Each Amazon EFS mount target has one corresponding
  requester-managed EC2 network interface. After the network interface is
  created, Amazon EFS sets the `NetworkInterfaceId` field in the mount
  target's description to the network interface ID, and the `IpAddress` field
  to its address. If network interface creation fails, the entire
  `CreateMountTarget` operation fails.

  </li> </ul> <note> The `CreateMountTarget` call returns only after creating
  the network interface, but while the mount target state is still
  `creating`, you can check the mount target creation status by calling the
  `DescribeMountTargets` operation, which among other things returns the
  mount target state.

  </note> We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the
  Availability Zones. There are cost considerations for using a file system
  in an Availability Zone through a mount target created in another
  Availability Zone. For more information, see [Amazon
  EFS](http://aws.amazon.com/efs/). In addition, by always using a mount
  target local to the instance's Availability Zone, you eliminate a partial
  failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which your mount target is
  created goes down, then you can't access your file system through that
  mount target.
