  Sets the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration on a container so

  For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is
  http://www.example.com to access your AWS Elemental MediaStore container at
  my.example.container.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability.

  To enable CORS on a container, you attach a CORS policy to the container. In the
  CORS policy, you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that
  can be executed on your container. The policy can contain up to 398,000
  characters. You can add up to 100 rules to a CORS policy. If more than one rule
  applies, the service uses the first applicable rule listed.
