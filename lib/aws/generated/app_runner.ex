  App Runner

  App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and
  cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source
  code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds.

  You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use,
  or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources.

  App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code
  repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed
  operations, high performance, scalability, and security.

  For more information about App Runner, see the [App Runner Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/). For release
  information, see the [App Runner Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/).

  To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access
  the API, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).  ## Endpoints

  For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see [App
  Runner endpoints and
  quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html) in the
  *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

  Associate your own domain name with the App Runner subdomain URL of your App

  the information in the `CustomDomain` record that's returned to add CNAME
  records to your Domain Name System (DNS). For each mapped domain name, add a
  mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate
  validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you

  latest active revision of the auto scaling configuration by default. You can
  optionally configure the service to use a specific revision.

  Configure a higher `MinSize` to increase the spread of your App Runner service
  over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is
  a higher minimal cost.

  Configure a lower `MaxSize` to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower
