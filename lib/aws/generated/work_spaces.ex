  Amazon WorkSpaces Service

  Amazon WorkSpaces enables you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft
  Windows or Amazon Linux desktops for your users, known as *WorkSpaces*.

  WorkSpaces eliminates the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex
  software. You can quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can
  access their virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.

  This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
  parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about the
  supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the
  Amazon WorkSpaces service, see [WorkSpaces endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html) in the *Amazon
  Web Services General Reference*.

  You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using the WorkSpaces console,
  Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more information about administering
  WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces Administration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/). For more
  information about using the Amazon WorkSpaces client application or web browser
  to access provisioned WorkSpaces, see the [Amazon WorkSpaces User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/). For more
  information about using the CLI to manage your WorkSpaces resources, see the
  [WorkSpaces section of the CLI Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/workspaces/index.html).

  Terminates the specified WorkSpaces.

  Terminating a WorkSpace is a permanent action and cannot be undone. The user's
  data is destroyed. If you need to archive any user data, contact Amazon Web
  Services Support before terminating the WorkSpace.

  You can terminate a WorkSpace that is in any state except `SUSPENDED`.

  This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpaces have been
  completely terminated. After a WorkSpace is terminated, the `TERMINATED` state
  is returned only briefly before the WorkSpace directory metadata is cleaned up,
  so this state is rarely returned. To confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated,
  check for the WorkSpace ID by using [
  DescribeWorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaces.html).
  If the WorkSpace ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been successfully
  terminated.

  Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of charge to use with
  WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with your Simple AD or AD
  Connector directory for 30 consecutive days, this directory will be
  automatically deregistered for use with Amazon WorkSpaces, and you will be
  charged for this directory as per the [Directory Service pricing terms](http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/pricing/).

  To delete empty directories, see [ Delete the Directory for Your WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/delete-workspaces-directory.html).
  If you delete your Simple AD or AD Connector directory, you can always create a
  new one when you want to start using WorkSpaces again.

  Shares or unshares a connection alias with one account by specifying whether
  that account has permission to associate the connection alias with a directory.

  If the association permission is granted, the connection alias is shared with
  that account. If the association permission is revoked, the connection alias is
  unshared with the account. For more information, see [ Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon
  WorkSpaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/cross-region-redirection.html).

     Before performing this operation, call [
  DescribeConnectionAliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeConnectionAliases.html)
  to make sure that the current state of the connection alias is `CREATED`.

     To delete a connection alias that has been shared, the shared
  account must first disassociate the connection alias from any directories it has
  been associated with. Then you must unshare the connection alias from the
  account it has been shared with. You can delete a connection alias only after it
  is no longer shared with any accounts or associated with any directories.
