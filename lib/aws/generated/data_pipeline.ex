defmodule AWS.DataPipeline do
  @moduledoc """
  AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a
  pipeline.

  AWS Data Pipeline handles the details of scheduling and ensuring that data
  dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing the data.

  AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data
  Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common
  data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and running data
  analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data
  Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner
  to provide custom data management.

  AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set
  to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the
  transforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your task runner
  application to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for
  performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or
  converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task
  runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service,
  reporting progress to the web service as it does so. When the task is done, the
  task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.

  that match the `workerGroup` value passed in by the task runner and that was
  launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.

  If tasks are ready in the work queue, `PollForTask` returns a response
  immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, `PollForTask` uses
  long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds, during
  which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To
  accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The
  task runner should not call `PollForTask` again on the same `workerGroup` until
  it receives a response, and this can take up to 90 seconds.

  Task runners call `ReportTaskProgress` when assigned a task to acknowledge that
  it has the task.

  If the web service does not receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it
  assigns the task in a subsequent `PollForTask` call. After this initial
  acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes
  to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from
  15 minutes by specifying a `reportProgressTimeout` field in your pipeline.
