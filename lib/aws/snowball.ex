  @moduledoc """
  AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure
  devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data
  centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball
  commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is
  available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to
  create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a
  Snowball device, you'll need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3
  API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the [User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html).

  Returns a link to an Amazon S3 presigned URL for the manifest file

  call to the `GetJobManifest` action.

  The manifest is an encrypted file that you can download after your job
  enters the `WithCustomer` status. The manifest is decrypted by using the
  `UnlockCode` code value, when you pass both values to the Snowball through
  the Snowball client when the client is started for the first time.

  As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an
  `UnlockCode` value in the same location as the manifest file for that job.

  access to the Snowball associated with that job.
