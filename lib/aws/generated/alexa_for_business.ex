  Alexa for Business helps you use Alexa in your organization. Alexa for
  Business provides you with the tools to manage Alexa devices, enroll your
  users, and assign skills, at scale. You can build your own context-aware
  voice skills using the Alexa Skills Kit and the Alexa for Business API
  operations. You can also make these available as private skills for your
  organization. Alexa for Business makes it efficient to voice-enable your
  products and services, thus providing context-aware voice experiences for
  your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)
  can create fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa
  for Business, and manage them as shared devices in their organization.
