defmodule AWS.ARCZonalShift do
  @moduledoc """
  This is the API Reference Guide for the zonal shift feature of Amazon Route 53
  Application Recovery Controller.

  This guide is for developers who need detailed information about zonal shift API
  actions, data types, and errors.

  Zonal shift is in preview release for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
  Controller and is subject to change.

  Zonal shift in Route 53 ARC enables you to move traffic for a load balancer
  resource away from an Availability Zone. Starting a zonal shift helps your
  application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's bad code
  deployment or from an AWS infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone,
  reducing the impact and time lost from an issue in one zone.

  Supported AWS resources are automatically registered with Route 53 ARC.
  Resources that are registered for zonal shifts in Route 53 ARC are managed
  resources in Route 53 ARC. You can start a zonal shift for any managed resource
  in your account in a Region. At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for
  Network Load Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load
  balancing turned off.

  Zonal shifts are temporary. You must specify an expiration when you start a
  zonal shift, of up to three days initially. If you want to still keep traffic
  away from an Availability Zone, you can update the zonal shift and set a new
  expiration. You can also cancel a zonal shift, before it expires, for example,
  if you're ready to restore traffic to the Availability Zone.

  For more information about using zonal shift, see the [Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html).

  You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic away from an

  You can start a zonal shift in Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your
