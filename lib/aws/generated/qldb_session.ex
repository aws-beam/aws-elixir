  The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB

  Instead of interacting directly with this API, we recommend using the QLDB
  driver or the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on a ledger.

     If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The driver
  provides a high-level abstraction layer above this *QLDB Session* data plane and
  manages `SendCommand` API calls for you. For information and a list of supported
  programming languages, see [Getting started with the driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html)
  in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*.

     If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI),
  use the QLDB shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses the QLDB
  driver to interact with a ledger. For information, see [Accessing Amazon QLDB using the QLDB
  shell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/data-shell.html).
