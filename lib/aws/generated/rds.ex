  Amazon Relational Database Service

  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it
  easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

  It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard
  relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up
  developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.

  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL,
  Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These
  capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today
  with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon
  RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software
  that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB
  instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's
  demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and
  you pay only for the resources you use.

  This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming
  or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is
  asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as
  polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In
  this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied
  immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The
  reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics
  from the user guide.

  Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

  To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
  `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
  the shared DB cluster snapshot.

  You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services
  Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the
  `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action is the destination Amazon Web Services Region for
  the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB
  cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region, you must provide the
  following values:

    * `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon
  Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the
  DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

    * `PreSignedUrl` - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed
  request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action to be called in the source Amazon
  Web Services Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed
  URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API action that can
  be executed in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted
  DB cluster snapshot to be copied.

  The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

      * `KmsKeyId` - The Amazon Web Services KMS key
  identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot
  in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for
  both the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action that is called in the destination Amazon
  Web Services Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.

      * `DestinationRegion` - The name of the Amazon Web
  Services Region that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.

      * `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster
  snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This
  identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source
  Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB
  cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
  `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks like the following example:
  `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`.

  To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see [
  Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature
  Version
  4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)
  and [ Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify
  `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the CLI) instead of specifying
  `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a pre-signed
  URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source
  Amazon Web Services Region.

    * `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new
  copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

    * `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot
  identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier
  must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the
  same value as the `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` in the pre-signed URL.

  To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB
  cluster snapshot identified by `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` while that DB
  cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.

  Creates a custom DB engine version (CEV).

  A CEV is a binary volume snapshot of a database engine and specific AMI. The
  only supported engine is Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition with the January
  2021 or later RU/RUR.

  Amazon RDS, which is a fully managed service, supplies the Amazon Machine Image
  (AMI) and database software. The Amazon RDS database software is preinstalled,
  so you need only select a DB engine and version, and create your database. With
  Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle, you upload your database installation files in
  Amazon S3.

  When you create a custom engine version, you specify the files in a JSON
  document called a CEV manifest. This document describes installation .zip files
  stored in Amazon S3. RDS Custom creates your CEV from the installation files
  that you provided. This service model is called Bring Your Own Media (BYOM).

  Creation takes approximately two hours. If creation fails, RDS Custom issues
  `RDS-EVENT-0196` with the message `Creation failed for custom engine version`,
  and includes details about the failure. For example, the event prints missing
  files.

  After you create the CEV, it is available for use. You can create multiple CEVs,
  and create multiple RDS Custom instances from any CEV. You can also change the
  status of a CEV to make it available or inactive.

  The MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create CEVs isn't
  integrated with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail. If you turn on data logging for
  Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the `CreateCustomDbEngineVersion` event
  aren't logged. However, you might see calls from the API gateway that accesses
  your Amazon S3 bucket. These calls originate from the MediaImport service for
  the `CreateCustomDbEngineVersion` event.

  Creates a new DB cluster parameter group.

  Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB
  cluster.

  A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters
  for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To provide custom
  values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it
  using `ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup`. Once you've created a DB cluster
  parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using
  `ModifyDBCluster`.

  When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Aurora DB
  cluster, reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new
  DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.

  When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running Multi-AZ DB
  cluster, reboot the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter
  group and associated settings to take effect.

  After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5
  minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster
  parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon RDS to fully
  complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the
  default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that
  are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the
  character set for the default database defined by the `character_set_database`

  The DeleteDBInstance action deletes a previously provisioned DB instance.

  When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are
  deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the DB instance to be
  deleted by `DeleteDBInstance` are not deleted.

  If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is
  `deleting` until the DB snapshot is created. The API action `DescribeDBInstance`
  is used to monitor the status of this operation. The action can't be canceled or
  reverted once submitted.

  When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`,
  `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, you can only delete it when
  you skip creation of the final snapshot with the `SkipFinalSnapshot` parameter.

  If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't
  delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:

    * The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB
  cluster.

    * The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.

  To delete a DB instance in this case, first call the
  `PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster` API action to promote the DB cluster so it's no
  longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, then call the
  `DeleteDBInstance` API action to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.

  You might need to override the default certificate in the following situations:

    * You already migrated your applications to support the latest

  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) supports importing MySQL

  You can create a backup of your on-premises database, store it on Amazon Simple
  Storage Service (Amazon S3), and then restore the backup file onto a new Amazon
  RDS DB instance running MySQL. For more information, see [Importing Data into an Amazon RDS MySQL DB

  Restores a DB instance to an arbitrary point in time.

  You can restore to any point in time before the time identified by the
  LatestRestorableTime property. You can restore to a point up to the number of
  days specified by the BackupRetentionPeriod property.

  The target database is created with most of the original configuration, but in a
  system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security group, the default
  subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By default, the new DB
  instance is created as a single-AZ deployment except when the instance is a SQL
  Server instance that has an option group that is associated with mirroring; in
  this case, the instance becomes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ
  deployment.
