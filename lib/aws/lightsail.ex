  @moduledoc """
  Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It
  includes everything you need to launch your project quickly – instances
  (virtual private servers), managed databases, SSD-based block storage,
  static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN)
  distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and snapshots
  (backups) – for a low, predictable monthly price.

  You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console,
  Lightsail API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs. For more
  information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the [Lightsail Dev
  Guide](http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).

  This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data
  types, parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more
  information about the supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas
  for the Lightsail service, see [Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and
  Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in
  the *AWS General Reference*.

  Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for
  backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a
  Lightsail instance.

  You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however,
  snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time
  the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been
  cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any
  file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot
  should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to
  the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance,
  issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure
  a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while
  the snapshot status is pending.

  You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's
  system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from
  the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system
  volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a
  system volume, just define the `instance name` parameter when issuing the
  snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume
  will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block
  storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to
  access the data on the disk.

  a metric condition is met, the alarm can notify you by email, SMS text
  message, and a banner displayed on the Amazon Lightsail console. For more
  information, see [Alarms in Amazon

  Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore, their application is not

  which parameter updates are applied: `dynamic` or `pending-reboot`.
  Parameters marked with a `dynamic` apply type are applied immediately.
  Parameters marked with a `pending-reboot` apply type are applied only after
  the database is rebooted using the `reboot relational database` operation.
