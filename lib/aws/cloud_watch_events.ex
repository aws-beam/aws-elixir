  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
  resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events
  into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in
  the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules
  to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure
  rules to:

  <ul> <li> Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries
  when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running
  state.

  </li> <li> Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon
  Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or
  availability risks.

  </li> <li> Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an
  Amazon EBS volume.

  Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This operation

  Each partner event source can be used by one AWS account to create a
  matching partner event bus in that AWS account. A SaaS partner must create
  one partner event source for each AWS account that wants to receive those
  event types.

  A partner event source creates events based on resources within the SaaS
  partner's service or application.

  An AWS account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner
  event source can use that event bus to receive events from the partner, and
  then process them using AWS Events rules and targets.

  Partner event source names follow this format:

  ` *partner_name*/*event_namespace*/*event_name* `

  *partner_name* is determined during partner registration and identifies the
  partner to AWS customers. *event_namespace* is determined by the partner
  and is a way for the partner to categorize their events. *event_name* is
  determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify an event-generating
  resource within the partner system. The combination of *event_namespace*
  and *event_name* should help AWS customers decide whether to create an
  event bus to receive these events.

  Running `PutPermission` permits the specified AWS account or AWS
  organization to put events to the specified *event bus*. Amazon EventBridge
  (CloudWatch Events) rules in your account are triggered by these events
  arriving to an event bus in your account.

  For another account to send events to your account, that external account
  must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.

  To enable multiple AWS accounts to put events to your event bus, run
  `PutPermission` once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts
  are members of the same AWS organization, you can run `PutPermission` once
  specifying `Principal` as "*" and specifying the AWS organization ID in
  `Condition`, to grant permissions to all accounts in that organization.

  If you grant permissions using an organization, then accounts in that
  organization must specify a `RoleArn` with proper permissions when they use
  `PutTarget` to add your account's event bus as a target. For more
  information, see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
  Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html)
  in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

  Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or
  based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using `DisableRule`.

  A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated
  by AWS services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by
  SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus.
  If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their
  events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have
  created. For more information, see `CreateEventBus`.

  If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you
  specify in this `PutRule` command. If you omit arguments in `PutRule`, the
  old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced
  with null values.

  When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately
  start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for
  changes to take effect.

  A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules
  with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules
  with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule
  can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the
  rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.

  When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more
  tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources.
  You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user
  permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use
  the `PutRule` operation and assign tags, you must have both the
  `events:PutRule` and `events:TagResource` permissions.

  If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the `PutRule`
  operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use
  `TagResource` and `UntagResource`.

  Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource
  Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns
  and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event
  patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.

  In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops,
  where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that
  ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to
  the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent
  change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.

  To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not
  re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are
  found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.

  An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We
  recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your
  specified limit. For more information, see [Managing Your Costs with
  Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html).

  @doc """
  Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if
  they are already associated with the rule.

  Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.

  You can configure the following as targets for Events:

  <ul> <li> EC2 instances

  </li> <li> SSM Run Command

  </li> <li> SSM Automation

  </li> <li> AWS Lambda functions

  </li> <li> Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

  </li> <li> Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

  </li> <li> Amazon ECS tasks

  </li> <li> AWS Step Functions state machines

  </li> <li> AWS Batch jobs

  </li> <li> AWS CodeBuild projects

  </li> <li> Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline

  </li> <li> Amazon Inspector assessment templates

  </li> <li> Amazon SNS topics

  </li> <li> Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues

  </li> <li> The default event bus of another AWS account

  </li> <li> Amazon API Gateway REST APIs

  </li> <li> Redshift Clusters to invoke Data API ExecuteStatement on

  </li> </ul> Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the
  AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are `EC2 CreateSnapshot API
  call`, `EC2 RebootInstances API call`, `EC2 StopInstances API call`, and
  `EC2 TerminateInstances API call`.

  For some target types, `PutTargets` provides target-specific parameters. If
  the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard
  the event goes to by using the `KinesisParameters` argument. To invoke a
  command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the
  `RunCommandParameters` field.

  To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon
  EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS
  Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based
  policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state
  machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that
  you specify in the `RoleARN` argument in `PutTargets`. For more
  information, see [Authentication and Access
  Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html)
  in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

  If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission
  (using `PutPermission`), you can send events to that account. Set that
  account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the
  matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as
  the `Arn` value when you run `PutTargets`. If your account sends events to
  another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event
  sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving
  the event is not charged. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge
  (CloudWatch Events) Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/).

  <note> `Input`, `InputPath`, and `InputTransformer` are not available with
  `PutTarget` if the target is an event bus of a different AWS account.

  </note> If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target,
  and that account granted permission to your account through an organization
  instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a `RoleArn`
  with proper permissions in the `Target` structure. For more information,
  see [Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS
  Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html)
  in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

  For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
  `PutPermission`.

  **Input**, **InputPath**, and **InputTransformer** are mutually exclusive
  and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a
  matched event:

  <ul> <li> If none of the following arguments are specified for a target,
  then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the
  target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing
  from the event is passed to the target).

  </li> <li> If **Input** is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the
  matched event is overridden with this constant.

  </li> <li> If **InputPath** is specified in the form of JSONPath (for
  example, `$.detail`), then only the part of the event specified in the path
  is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is
  passed).

  </li> <li> If **InputTransformer** is specified, then one or more specified
  JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template
  that you specify as the input to the target.

  </li> </ul> When you specify `InputPath` or `InputTransformer`, you must
  use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.

  When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after,
  new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short
  period of time for changes to take effect.

  This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same
  time. If that happens, `FailedEntryCount` is non-zero in the response and
