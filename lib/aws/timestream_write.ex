  Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database
  service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time series
  data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT
  sensor data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze
  industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management and maintenance.
  You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the
  performance and availability of your applications. Timestream is built from
  the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store time series data.
  It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales
  based on the volume of data ingested and on the query volume to ensure you
  receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data
  grows over time, Timestream’s adaptive query processing engine spans across
  storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing costs.

  Modifies the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store for

  store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours, the memory
  store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will be populated
  with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made. Timestream does
  not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate the memory store.

  The WriteRecords operation enables you to write your time series data into
  Timestream. You can specify a single data point or a batch of data points
  to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you with a flexible
  schema that auto detects the column names and data types for your
  Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of the data
  points you specify when invoking writes into the database. Timestream
  support eventual consistency read semantics. This means that when you query
  data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the query
  results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write
  operation. The results may also include some stale data. If you repeat the
  query request after a short time, the results should return the latest
  data. Service quotas apply. For more information, see [Access
