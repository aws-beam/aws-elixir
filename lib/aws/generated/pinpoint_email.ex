  Amazon Pinpoint Email Service

  Welcome to the *Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference*.

  This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version
  1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.

  [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint) is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You
  can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and
  push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access
  to options that are unique to the email channel and supplement the options
  provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.

  If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the
  [Amazon Pinpoint Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).
  The *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide* provides tutorials, code samples, and
  procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically
  and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other
  types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such
  as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply
  to using the service.

  The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it
  provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions
  and endpoints where the API is currently available, see [AWS Service Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region)
  in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. To learn more about AWS Regions,
  see [Managing AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in the
  *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

  In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability
  Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
  low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
  Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and
  redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of
  Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

  Verifies an email identity for use with Amazon Pinpoint.

  In Amazon Pinpoint, an identity is an email address or domain that you use when
  you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email with Amazon
  Pinpoint, you first have to verify it. By verifying an address, you demonstrate
  that you're the owner of the address, and that you've given Amazon Pinpoint
  permission to send email from the address.

  When you verify an email address, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email to the address.
  Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the
  verification email.

  When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which
  you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS
  configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint
  detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes
  around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.

  Sends an email message.

  You can use the Amazon Pinpoint Email API to send two types of messages:

    * **Simple** – A standard email message. When you create this type
  of message, you specify the sender, the recipient, and the message body, and
  Amazon Pinpoint assembles the message for you.

    * **Raw** – A raw, MIME-formatted email message. When you send this
  type of email, you have to specify all of the message headers, as well as the
  message body. You can use this message type to send messages that contain
  attachments. The message that you specify has to be a valid MIME message.

  A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in

  have as many as 50 tags.

  Each tag consists of a required *tag key* and an associated *tag value*, both of
