  Returns information about a stream, including the current status of the stream,
  its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the composition of its shards, and its
  corresponding DynamoDB table.

  You can call `DescribeStream` at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.

  Each shard in the stream has a `SequenceNumberRange` associated with it. If the
  `SequenceNumberRange` has a `StartingSequenceNumber` but no
  `EndingSequenceNumber`, then the shard is still open (able to receive more
  stream records). If both `StartingSequenceNumber` and `EndingSequenceNumber` are
  present, then that shard is closed and can no longer receive more data.

  Retrieves the stream records from a given shard.

  Specify a shard iterator using the `ShardIterator` parameter. The shard iterator
  specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading stream
  records sequentially. If there are no stream records available in the portion of
  the shard that the iterator points to, `GetRecords` returns an empty list. Note
  that it might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains
  stream records.

  `GetRecords` can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data or 1000 stream records,
  whichever comes first.
