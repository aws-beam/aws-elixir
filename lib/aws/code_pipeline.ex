  AWS CodePipeline

  **Overview**

  This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides
  descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some
  functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For
  more information, see the [AWS CodePipeline User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

  You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages,
  actions, and transitions.

  *Pipelines* are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is
  uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.

  You can work with pipelines by calling:

  <ul> <li> `CreatePipeline`, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.

  </li> <li> `DeletePipeline`, which deletes the specified pipeline.

  </li> <li> `GetPipeline`, which returns information about the pipeline
  structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource
  Name (ARN).

  </li> <li> `GetPipelineExecution`, which returns information about a
  specific execution of a pipeline.

  </li> <li> `GetPipelineState`, which returns information about the current
  state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.

  </li> <li> `ListActionExecutions`, which returns action-level details for
  past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
  including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred
  during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.

  </li> <li> `ListPipelines`, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines
  associated with your account.

  </li> <li> `ListPipelineExecutions`, which gets a summary of the most
  recent executions for a pipeline.

  </li> <li> `StartPipelineExecution`, which runs the most recent revision of
  an artifact through the pipeline.

  </li> <li> `UpdatePipeline`, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes
  to the structure of the pipeline.

  </li> </ul> Pipelines include *stages*. Each stage contains one or more
  actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in
  success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and
  remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the
  source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact
  through the pipeline. You can call `GetPipelineState`, which displays the
  status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or
  `GetPipeline`, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline,
  including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the
  structure of stages and actions, see [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure
  Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html).

  Pipeline stages include *actions* that are categorized into categories such
  as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example,
  you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a
  source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions
  directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when
  working with pipeline operations such as `CreatePipeline` and
  `GetPipelineState`. Valid action categories are:

  <ul> <li> Source

  </li> <li> Build

  </li> <li> Test

  </li> <li> Deploy

  </li> <li> Approval

  </li> <li> Invoke

  </li> </ul> Pipelines also include *transitions*, which allow the
  transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the
  actions in one stage complete.

  You can work with transitions by calling:

  <ul> <li> `DisableStageTransition`, which prevents artifacts from
  transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.

  </li> <li> `EnableStageTransition`, which enables transition of artifacts
  between stages in a pipeline.

  </li> </ul> **Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline**

  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own
  integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the
  standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to
  work with the following items:

  **Jobs**, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source
  action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.

  You can work with jobs by calling:

  <ul> <li> `AcknowledgeJob`, which confirms whether a job worker has
  received the specified job.

  </li> <li> `GetJobDetails`, which returns the details of a job.

  </li> <li> `PollForJobs`, which determines whether there are any jobs to
  act on.

  </li> <li> `PutJobFailureResult`, which provides details of a job failure.

  </li> <li> `PutJobSuccessResult`, which provides details of a job success.

  </li> </ul> **Third party jobs**, which are instances of an action created
  by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions
  are created by members of the AWS Partner Network.

  You can work with third party jobs by calling:

  <ul> <li> `AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob`, which confirms whether a job worker
  has received the specified job.

  </li> <li> `GetThirdPartyJobDetails`, which requests the details of a job
  for a partner action.

  </li> <li> `PollForThirdPartyJobs`, which determines whether there are any
  jobs to act on.

  </li> <li> `PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult`, which provides details of a job
  failure.

  </li> <li> `PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult`, which provides details of a job
  success.

  </li> </ul>
