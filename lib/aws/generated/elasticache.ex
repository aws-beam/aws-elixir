  Amazon ElastiCache

  Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up,
  operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

  With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,
  in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in
  launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup,
  scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed
  cache deployment.

  In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get
  enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with
  their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.

  Adds up to 50 cost allocation tags to the named resource. A cost allocation
  tag is a key-value pair where the key and value are case-sensitive. You can
  use cost allocation tags to categorize and track your AWS costs.

  When you apply tags to your ElastiCache resources, AWS generates a cost
  allocation report as a comma-separated value (CSV) file with your usage and
  costs aggregated by your tags. You can apply tags that represent business
  categories (such as cost centers, application names, or owners) to organize
  your costs across multiple services. For more information, see [Using Cost

  Creates a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled)
  replication group.

  This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a
  secondary replication group associated with a Global Datastore.

  A Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of
  clusters, where one of the clusters is a read/write primary and the others
  are read-only replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated
  to the replicas.

  A Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group is a collection of 1 to 90
  node groups (shards). Each node group (shard) has one read/write primary
  node and up to 5 read-only replica nodes. Writes to the primary are
  asynchronously propagated to the replicas. Redis (cluster mode enabled)
  replication groups partition the data across node groups (shards).

  When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been
  successfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a
  total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of
  node groups (console: shards), you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for

  Reboots some, or all, of the cache nodes within a provisioned cluster. This
  operation applies any modified cache parameter groups to the cluster. The
  reboot operation takes place as soon as possible, and results in a
  momentary outage to the cluster. During the reboot, the cluster status is
  set to REBOOTING.

  The reboot causes the contents of the cache (for each cache node being
  rebooted) to be lost.

  When the reboot is complete, a cluster event is created.

  Rebooting a cluster is currently supported on Memcached and Redis (cluster
  mode disabled) clusters. Rebooting is not supported on Redis (cluster mode
  enabled) clusters.

  If you make changes to parameters that require a Redis (cluster mode
  enabled) cluster reboot for the changes to be applied, see [Rebooting a
  Cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Clusters.Rebooting.html)

  Represents the input of a `TestFailover` operation which test automatic
  failover on a specified node group (called shard in the console) in a
  replication group (called cluster in the console).

  <p class="title"> **Note the following**

  <ul> <li> A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on
  up to 5 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and AWS CLI) in
  any rolling 24-hour period.

  </li> <li> If calling this operation on shards in different clusters
  (called replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made
  concurrently.

  </li> <li> If calling this operation multiple times on different shards in
  the same Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the first node
  replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.

  </li> <li> To determine whether the node replacement is complete you can
  check Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the
  ElastiCache API. Look for the following automatic failover related events,
  listed here in order of occurrance:

  <ol> <li> Replication group message: `Test Failover API called for node
  group &lt;node-group-id&gt;`

  </li> <li> Cache cluster message: `Failover from master node
  &lt;primary-node-id&gt; to replica node &lt;node-id&gt; completed`

  </li> <li> Replication group message: `Failover from master node
  &lt;primary-node-id&gt; to replica node &lt;node-id&gt; completed`

  </li> <li> Cache cluster message: `Recovering cache nodes &lt;node-id&gt;`

  </li> <li> Cache cluster message: `Finished recovery for cache nodes
  &lt;node-id&gt;`

  </li> </ol> For more information see:
