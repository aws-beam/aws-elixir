  AWS Resource Groups

  AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2
  instances, Amazon Relational Database Service databases, and Amazon S3 buckets
  into groups using criteria that you define as tags.

  A resource group is a collection of resources that match the resource types
  specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You can
  create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure,
  lifecycle stages, regions, application layers, or virtually any criteria.
  Resource Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those in AWS
  Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems
  Manager. Groups of tagged resources also let you quickly view a custom console
  in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and other monitoring
  data about member resources.

  To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that
  identify the criteria that members of the group have in common. Tags are
  key-value pairs.

  For more information about Resource Groups, see the [AWS Resource Groups User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

  AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the
  following types of operations.

    * Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource
  groups and resource query entities

    * Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups

    * Resolving resource group member ARNs so they can be returned as
  search results

    * Getting data about resources that are members of a group

    * Searching AWS resources based on a resource query
