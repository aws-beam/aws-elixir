defmodule AWS.Budgets do
  @moduledoc """
  The Amazon Web Services Budgets API enables you to use Amazon Web Services
  Budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

  The API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of
  the actions and data types for Amazon Web Services Budgets.

  Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:

    * How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier
  limits

    * Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your
  Reserved Instances (RIs)

    * Your current estimated charges from Amazon Web Services, and how
  much your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month

    * How much of your budget has been used

  Amazon Web Services updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets
  track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the
  following types of budgets:

    * **Cost budgets** - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.

    * **Usage budgets** - Plan how much you want to use one or more
  services.

    * **RI utilization budgets** - Define a utilization threshold, and
  receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see
  if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.

    * **RI coverage budgets** - Define a coverage threshold, and receive
  alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below
  that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by
  a reservation.

  Service Endpoint

  The Amazon Web Services Budgets API provides the following endpoint:

    * https://budgets.amazonaws.com

  For information about costs that are associated with the Amazon Web Services
  Budgets API, see [Amazon Web Services Cost Management Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).
