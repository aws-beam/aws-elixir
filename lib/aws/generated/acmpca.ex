  The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters

  Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must
  specify the CA configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL)
  configuration, the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid
  accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the
  name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key,
  the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject
  information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in
  days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will
  contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in
  certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the

  Remove one or more tags from your private CA. A tag consists of a key-value
  pair. If you do not specify the value portion of the tag when calling this
  action, the tag will be removed regardless of value. If you specify a
  value, the tag is removed only if it is associated with the specified
  value. To add tags to a private CA, use the
  [TagCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_TagCertificateAuthority.html).
  Call the
  [ListTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ListTags.html)
  action to see what tags are associated with your CA.

  Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate authority
  (CA). Your private CA must be in the `ACTIVE` or `DISABLED` state before
  you can update it. You can disable a private CA that is in the `ACTIVE`
  state or make a CA that is in the `DISABLED` state active again.

  <note> Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the
  S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not
  have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For
  more information, see [Configure Access to ACM Private
  CA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/PcaAuthAccess.html).
