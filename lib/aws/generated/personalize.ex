  Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version.

  When a client calls the
  [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html) and
  [GetPersonalizedRanking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.html)
  APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.

  ## Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling

  A transaction is a single `GetRecommendations` or `GetPersonalizedRanking` call.
  Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon
  Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (`minProvisionedTPS`) specifies the
  baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum
  billing charge.

  If your TPS increases beyond `minProvisionedTPS`, Amazon Personalize auto-scales
  the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below `minProvisionedTPS`.
  There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss
  of transactions.

  The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within a
  5-minute window. You pay for maximum of either the minimum provisioned TPS or
  the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low `minProvisionedTPS`, track your
  usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the `minProvisionedTPS`
  as necessary.

  ## Status

  A campaign can be in one of the following states:

    * CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

    * DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

  To get the campaign status, call `DescribeCampaign`.

  Wait until the `status` of the campaign is `ACTIVE` before asking the campaign
  for recommendations.

  A dataset group is a container for Amazon Personalize resources. A dataset group
  can contain at most three datasets, one for each type of dataset:

  A dataset group can be a Domain dataset group, where you specify a domain and
  use pre-configured resources like recommenders, or a Custom dataset group, where
  you use custom resources, such as a solution with a solution version, that you
  deploy with a campaign. If you start with a Domain dataset group, you can still
  add custom resources such as solutions and solution versions trained with
  recipes for custom use cases and deployed with campaigns.

  A dataset group can be in one of the following states:

    * CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

    * DELETE PENDING

  To get the status of the dataset group, call `DescribeDatasetGroup`. If the
  status shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a `failureReason` key,

  You must wait until the `status` of the dataset group is `ACTIVE` before adding
  a dataset to the group.

  You can specify an Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt the datasets in

  Personalize makes a copy of your data and processes it internally. For

  Creates a recommender with the recipe (a Domain dataset group use case) you

  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a
  [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html)
  request.

  ## Minimum recommendation requests per second

  When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's minimum
  recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation requests per
  second (`minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`) specifies the baseline
  recommendation request throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize. The default
  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is `1`. A recommendation request is a single
  `GetRecommendations` operation. Request throughput is measured in requests per
  second and Amazon Personalize uses your requests per second to derive your
  requests per hour and the price of your recommender usage.

  If your requests per second increases beyond
  `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the
  provisioned capacity up and down, but never below
  `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`. There's a short time delay while the
  capacity is increased that might cause loss of requests.

  Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based on
  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond) or the actual number of requests. The actual
  request throughput used is calculated as the average requests/second within a
  one-hour window. We recommend starting with the default
  `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond`, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch
  metrics, and then increase the `minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond` as
  necessary.

  Creates the configuration for training a model.

  A trained model is known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you
  train the model (create a solution) by calling the `CreateSolutionVersion`
  operation. Every time you call `CreateSolutionVersion`, a new version of the
  solution is created.

  After creating a solution version, you check its accuracy by calling
  `GetSolutionMetrics`. When you are satisfied with the version, you deploy it
  using `CreateCampaign`. The campaign provides recommendations to a client
  through the
  [GetRecommendations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html)
  API.

  To train a model, Amazon Personalize requires training data and a recipe. The
  training data comes from the dataset group that you provide in the request. A
  recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature transformation. You can
  specify one of the predefined recipes provided by Amazon Personalize.
  Alternatively, you can specify `performAutoML` and Amazon Personalize will
  analyze your data and select the optimum USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe for you.

  Amazon Personalize doesn't support configuring the `hpoObjective` for solution
  hyperparameter optimization at this time.
