  Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage links
  between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using *CloudWatch
  cross-account observability*.

  With CloudWatch cross-account observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot
  applications that span multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search,
  visualize, and analyze your metrics, logs, and traces in any of the linked
  accounts without account boundaries.

  ` Set up one or more Amazon Web Services accounts as *monitoring accounts* and
  link them with multiple *source accounts*. A monitoring account is a central
  Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability data
  generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual Amazon Web
  Services account that generates observability data for the resources that reside
  in it. Source accounts share their observability data with the monitoring
  account. The shared observability data can include metrics in Amazon CloudWatch,
  logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and traces in X-Ray.
