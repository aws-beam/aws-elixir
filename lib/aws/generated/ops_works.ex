  Welcome to the *AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference*.

  This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks
  Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.

  AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an
  integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle. For
  information about this product, go to the [AWS OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) details page.

  ## SDKs and CLI

  The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS
  Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement
  applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:

    * [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

    * [AWS SDK for Java](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html)

    * [AWS SDK for .NET](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm)

    * [AWS SDK for PHP 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html)

    * [AWS SDK for Ruby](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/)     * [AWS SDK for
  Node.js](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/)

    * [AWS SDK for Python(Boto)](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html)

  ## Endpoints

  AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must
  connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or
  managed within the endpoint in which they are created.

    * opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in
  the AWS console)

    * opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

    * opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com

  ## Chef Versions

  When you call `CreateStack`, `CloneStack`, or `UpdateStack` we recommend you use
  the `ConfigurationManager` parameter to specify the Chef version. The
  recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks
  use Chef 12.2. For more information, see [Chef Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html).

  You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend
  migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as possible.

  We do not recommend using this action to register instances. The complete
