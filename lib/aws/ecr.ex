  Amazon Elastic Container Registry

  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image
  registry service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their
  preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a
  secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container
  Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with
  resource-based permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2
  instances can access repositories and images.

  Checks the availability of one or more image layers in a repository.

  When an image is pushed to a repository, each image layer is checked to

  image layer is skipped.

  used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most cases, you should
  use the `docker` CLI to pull, tag, and push images.
