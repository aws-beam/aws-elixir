  AWS Cloud9

  AWS Cloud9 is a collection of tools that you can use to code, build, run,
  test, debug, and release software in the cloud.

  For more information about AWS Cloud9, see the [AWS Cloud9 User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide).

  AWS Cloud9 supports these operations:

  <ul> <li> `CreateEnvironmentEC2`: Creates an AWS Cloud9 development
  environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then connects from the
  instance to the environment.

  </li> <li> `CreateEnvironmentMembership`: Adds an environment member to an
  environment.

  </li> <li> `DeleteEnvironment`: Deletes an environment. If an Amazon EC2
  instance is connected to the environment, also terminates the instance.

  </li> <li> `DeleteEnvironmentMembership`: Deletes an environment member
  from an environment.

  </li> <li> `DescribeEnvironmentMemberships`: Gets information about
  environment members for an environment.

  </li> <li> `DescribeEnvironments`: Gets information about environments.

  </li> <li> `DescribeEnvironmentStatus`: Gets status information for an
  environment.

  </li> <li> `ListEnvironments`: Gets a list of environment identifiers.

  </li> <li> `ListTagsForResource`: Gets the tags for an environment.

  </li> <li> `TagResource`: Adds tags to an environment.

  </li> <li> `UntagResource`: Removes tags from an environment.

  </li> <li> `UpdateEnvironment`: Changes the settings of an existing
  environment.

  </li> <li> `UpdateEnvironmentMembership`: Changes the settings of an
  existing environment member for an environment.

  </li> </ul>
