defmodule AWS.Lightsail do
  @moduledoc """
  Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) for developers who need to build websites or web applications.

  It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances
  (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets, managed
  databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content
  delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and
  resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price.

  You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail
  API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or SDKs. For more information about
  Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the [Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).

  This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
  parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the
  supported AWS Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service,
  see [Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lightsail.html) in the
  *AWS General Reference*.

  You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data

  You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots
  only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot
  command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any
  applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the
  disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete.
  Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should
  unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk
  snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete
  snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is
  pending.

  You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system
  volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system
  volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you
  would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just
  define the `instance name` parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a
  snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the
  snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and

  When you make periodic snapshots of a disk, the snapshots are incremental, and
  only the blocks on the device that have changed since your last snapshot are
  saved in the new snapshot. When you delete a snapshot, only the data not needed

  been deleted, all active snapshots will have access to all the information
  needed to restore the disk.
