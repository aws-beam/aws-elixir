  Amazon SES API v2

  Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference.

  This guide provides information about the Amazon SES API v2, including supported
  operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.

  [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint) is an AWS service that you can use to send email messages to your customers.

  If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review the
  [Amazon Simple Email Service Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/). The *Amazon SES
  Developer Guide* provides information and code samples that demonstrate how to
  use Amazon SES API v2 features programmatically.

  The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an
  endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints
  where the API is currently available, see [AWS Service Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region)
  in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*. To learn more about AWS Regions,
  see [Managing AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) in the
  *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

  In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability
  Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private,
  low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
  Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and
  redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of
  Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

  Starts the process of verifying an email identity.

  An *identity* is an email address or domain that you use when you send email.
  Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By
  verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity,
  and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the
  identity.

  When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your
  email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification
  email.

  When you verify a domain without specifying the `DkimSigningAttributes` object,
  this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into
  CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your
  domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS
  configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as [Easy DKIM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html).

  Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own
  public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own
  DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the `CreateEmailIdentity` operation
  has to include the `DkimSigningAttributes` object. When you specify this object,
  you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the
  public key that you want to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.
