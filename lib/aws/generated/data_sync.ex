  DataSync is a managed data transfer service that makes it simpler for you to
  automate moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon Simple Storage
  Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).

  This API interface reference for DataSync contains documentation for a
  programming interface that you can use to manage DataSync.

  Cancels execution of a task.

  When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly
  interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might
  be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new
  task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete,
  file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to
  other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these
  cases, DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task
  execution.

  Activates an DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host.

  The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the
  activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Services
  Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the
  Amazon Web Services Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon
  EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this Amazon Web Services Region.

  You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent
  access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public
  internet.

  You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents,
  all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use
  multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be
  AVAILABLE for the task to run.

  Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services on a regular basis,
  using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.
