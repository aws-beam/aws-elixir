  Amazon AppStream 2.0

  This is the *Amazon AppStream 2.0 API Reference*. This documentation
  provides descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in
  AppStream 2.0. AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed, secure application
  streaming service that lets you stream desktop applications to users
  without rewriting applications. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources
  that are required to host and run your applications, scales automatically,
  and provides access to your users on demand.

  <note> You can call the AppStream 2.0 API operations by using an interface
  VPC endpoint (interface endpoint). For more information, see [Access
  AppStream 2.0 API Operations and CLI Commands Through an Interface VPC
  Endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/access-api-cli-through-interface-vpc-endpoint.html)
  in the *Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide*.
