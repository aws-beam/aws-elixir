  Registers the resource as managed by the Data Catalog.

  To add or update data, Lake Formation needs read/write access to the chosen
  Amazon S3 path. Choose a role that you know has permission to do this, or
  choose the AWSServiceRoleForLakeFormationDataAccess service-linked role.
  When you register the first Amazon S3 path, the service-linked role and a
  new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first
  path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When
  you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing
  policy.

  The following request registers a new location and gives AWS Lake Formation
  permission to use the service-linked role to access that location.

  `ResourceArn = arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket UseServiceLinkedRole = true`

  If `UseServiceLinkedRole` is not set to true, you must provide or set the
  `RoleArn`:

  `arn:aws:iam::12345:role/my-data-access-role`
