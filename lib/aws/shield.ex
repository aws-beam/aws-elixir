  To use the services of the DRT and make an `AssociateDRTLogBucket` request,

  Authorizes the DDoS Response team (DRT), using the specified role, to
  access your AWS account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during
  potential attacks. This enables the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF
  configuration and create or update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs.

  You can associate only one `RoleArn` with your subscription. If you submit
  an `AssociateDRTRole` request for an account that already has an associated
  role, the new `RoleArn` will replace the existing `RoleArn`.

  Prior to making the `AssociateDRTRole` request, you must attach the
  [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy)
  managed policy to the role you will specify in the request. For more
  information see [Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies](
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html).
  The role must also trust the service principal ` drt.shield.amazonaws.com`.
  For more information, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements:
  Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html).

  The DRT will have access only to your AWS WAF and Shield resources. By
  submitting this request, you authorize the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF and
  Shield configuration and create and update AWS WAF rules and web ACLs on
  your behalf. The DRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by
  you.

  You must have the `iam:PassRole` permission to make an `AssociateDRTRole`
  request. For more information, see [Granting a User Permissions to Pass a
  Role to an AWS
  Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html).

  To use the services of the DRT and make an `AssociateDRTRole` request, you

  You can add protection to only a single resource with each CreateProtection
  request. If you want to add protection to multiple resources at once, use
  the [AWS WAF console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/waf/). For more
