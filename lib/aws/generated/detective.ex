defmodule AWS.Detective do
  @moduledoc """
  Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you
  analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  workloads.

  Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API
  calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
  (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

  The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior
  graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member
  accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.

  Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage
  graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected
  endpoint.

  A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:

    * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
  behavior graph.

    * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.

    * Add member accounts to a behavior graph.

    * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.

  A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:

    * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.

    * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

    * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

    * Remove their account from a behavior graph.

  All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See [Logging Detective API Calls with
  CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

  We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
  administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case
  of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior
  graph.

  Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as

  This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.

  Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been
  enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this
  requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty
  prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks
  whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota,
  then you cannot enable Detective.
