defmodule AWS.Proton do
  @moduledoc """
  This is the Proton Service API Reference.

  It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the
  [actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) and [data
  types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html)
  for the Proton service.

  The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the
  XML response.

  Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an API. For
  more information, see the [Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html).

  The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create
  service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling
  for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select
  from the available service templates to automate their application or service
  deployments.

  Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys
  and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations.

  When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys
  their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on Proton,
  developers need permissions to the service *create*, *list*, *update* and
  *delete* API operations and the service instance *list* and *update* API
  operations.

  To learn more about Proton administration, see the [Proton Administrator Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/adminguide/Welcome.html).

  To learn more about deploying serverless and containerized applications on
  Proton, see the [Proton User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).

  ## Ensuring Idempotency

  When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result
  before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations
  might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete,
  even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to
  determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the
  request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully.
  However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the
  operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources
  than you intended.

  *Idempotency* ensures that an API request action completes no more than one
  time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes
  successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing
  any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such
  as the current creation status.

  The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure
  idempotency.

  ## Idempotent create APIs with a client token

  The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a *client
  token*. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support
  idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive
  string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one
  of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you
  *don't* reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you donâ€™t provide
  a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided
  by SDKs.

  Given a request action that has succeeded:

  If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters,
  the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning
  the original resource detail data in the response.

  If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the
  parameters are different, the retry throws a `ValidationException` with an
  `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

  Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the
  request with the expired token, a new resource is created.

  If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is
  created.

  Idempotent create APIs with a client token:

    * CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion

    * CreateServiceTemplateVersion

    * CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection

  ## Idempotent create APIs

  Given a request action that has succeeded:

  If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource
  *hasn't* been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further
  actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.

  If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a
  `ConflictException`.

  If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a
  `ValidationException` with an `IdempotentParameterMismatch` error.

  Idempotent create APIs:

    * CreateEnvironmentTemplate

    * CreateServiceTemplate

    * CreateEnvironment

    * CreateService

  ## Idempotent delete APIs

  Given a request action that has succeeded:

  When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was
  deleted, its metadata is returned in the response.

  If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty.

  In both cases, the retry succeeds.

  Idempotent delete APIs:

    * DeleteEnvironmentTemplate

    * DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion

    * DeleteServiceTemplate

    * DeleteServiceTemplateVersion

    * DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection

  ## Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs

  Given a request action that has succeeded:

  If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request
  delete operation status is `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`, the retry returns the resource
  detail data in the response without performing any further actions.

  If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty
  response.

  Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:

    * DeleteEnvironment

    * DeleteService

  Update an environment.

  If the environment is associated with an environment account connection, *don't*
  update or include the `protonServiceRoleArn` and `provisioningRepository`
  parameter to update or connect to an environment account connection.

  You can only update to a new environment account connection if it was created in
  the same environment account that the current environment account connection was
  created in and is associated with the current environment.

  If the environment *isn't* associated with an environment account connection,
  *don't* update or include the `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameter to
  update or connect to an environment account connection.

  You can update either the `environmentAccountConnectionId` or
  `protonServiceRoleArn` parameter and value. You canâ€™t update both.

  If the environment was provisioned with pull request provisioning, include the
  `provisioningRepository` parameter and omit the `protonServiceRoleArn` and
  `environmentAccountConnectionId` parameters.

  If the environment wasn't provisioned with pull request provisioning, omit the
  `provisioningRepository` parameter.

  There are four modes for updating an environment as described in the following.
  The `deploymentType` field defines the mode.

  ## Definitions

  ###

  `NONE`

  In this mode, a deployment *doesn't* occur. Only the requested metadata
  parameters are updated.

  ###

  `CURRENT_VERSION`

  In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the new spec that you
  provide. Only requested parameters are updated. *Donâ€™t* include minor or major
  version parameters when you use this `deployment-type`.

  ###

  `MINOR_VERSION`

  In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published,
  recommended (latest) minor version of the current major version in use, by
  default. You can also specify a different minor version of the current major
  version in use.

  ###

  `MAJOR_VERSION`

  In this mode, the environment is deployed and updated with the published,
  recommended (latest) major and minor version of the current template, by
  default. You can also specify a different major version that's higher than the
  major version in use and a minor version (optional).
