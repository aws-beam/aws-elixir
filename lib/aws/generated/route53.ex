  Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone.

  To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already

  If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services
  account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different

  Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative
  DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name.

  For example, you can use `ChangeResourceRecordSets` to create a resource record
  set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP
  address of 192.0.2.44.

  ## Deleting Resource Record Sets

  To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you
  specified when you created it.

  ## Change Batches and Transactional Changes

  The request body must include a document with a
  `ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest` element. The request body contains a list of
  change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
  transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then
  either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This
  ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the
  resource record sets in a hosted zone.

  For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the
  `CNAME` resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource
  record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route
  53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record
  set in a single operation. If validation for either the `DELETE` or the `CREATE`
  action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original `CNAME` record
  continues to exist.

  If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single
  change batch, Route 53 returns an `InvalidChangeBatch` error.

  ## Traffic Flow

  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either
  the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for
  traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a
  traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names
  (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same
  hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the
  new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see [Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS
  Traffic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/traffic-flow.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  ## Create, Delete, and Upsert

  Use `ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest` to perform the following actions:

    * `CREATE`: Creates a resource record set that has the specified
  values.

    * `DELETE`: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the
  specified values.

    * `UPSERT`: If a resource set exists Route 53 updates it with the
  values in the request.

  ## Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets

  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you
  want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML
  elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.

  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."

  Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all
  of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create,
  delete, or update by using `ChangeResourceRecordSets`.

  ## Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers

  When you submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets` request, Route 53 propagates your
  changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are
  propagating, `GetChange` returns a status of `PENDING`. When propagation is
  complete, `GetChange` returns a status of `INSYNC`. Changes generally propagate
  to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see
  [GetChange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_GetChange.html).  ## Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests

  ## ELB Load Balancers

  If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load
  balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances.
  When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings
  for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health
  check.

  ## Private Hosted Zones

  You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private
  hosted zone. Note the following:

    * Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health
  of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address
  to the instance in the VPC.

    * You can configure a health checker to check the health of an
  external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.

    * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the
  metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm.
  For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the
  Amazon EC2 `StatusCheckFailed` metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then
  create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information
  about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console,

  Creates a new public or private hosted zone.

  You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route
  traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains
  (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted
  zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains
  within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).

  You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa.
  Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new
  resource record sets.

  For more information about charges for hosted zones, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/).

  Note the following:

    * You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such
  as .com.

    * For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default
  SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and
  NS records, see [NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/SOA-NSrecords.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you
  can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the
  `DelegationSetId` element.

    * If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53,
  you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS
  service for the domain. For more information, see [Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon
  Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  When you submit a `CreateHostedZone` request, the initial status of the hosted
  zone is `PENDING`. For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA
  records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA
  records are available, the status of the zone changes to `INSYNC`.

  The `CreateHostedZone` request requires the caller to have an `ec2:DescribeVpcs`
  permission.

  When creating private hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to the same
  partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition is a group of Amazon Web
  Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services account is scoped to one partition.

  Creates a configuration for DNS query logging.

  After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to
  publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

  DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for
  a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:

    * Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query

    * Domain or subdomain that was requested

    * DNS record type, such as A or AAAA

    * DNS response code, such as `NoError` or `ServFail`

  ## Definitions

  ### Log Group and Resource Policy

  Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following
  operations.

  If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53
  performs these operations automatically.

     Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which
  you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:

       You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.

       You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to
  create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query
  logging for.

       When you create log groups for query logging, we
  recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:

  `/aws/route53/*hosted zone name* `

  In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one
  or more log groups and the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as
  Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that
  you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use
  the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query
  logging.

     Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the
  permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to
  log streams. For the value of `Resource`, specify the ARN for the log group that
  you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the
  CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations,
  replace the hosted zone name with `*`, for example:

  `arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*`

  To avoid the confused deputy problem, a security issue where an entity without a
  permission for an action can coerce a more-privileged entity to perform it, you
  can optionally limit the permissions that a service has to a resource in a
  resource-based policy by supplying the following values:

       For `aws:SourceArn`, supply the hosted zone ARN used in
  creating the query logging configuration. For example, `aws:SourceArn:
  arn:aws:route53:::hostedzone/hosted zone ID`.

       For `aws:SourceAccount`, supply the account ID for the
  account that creates the query logging configuration. For example,
  `aws:SourceAccount:111111111111`.

  For more information, see [The confused deputy problem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/confused-deputy.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services IAM User Guide*.

  You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You
  must use the CloudWatch API, one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI.

  ### Log Streams and Edge Locations

  When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does
  the following:

     Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the
  edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log
  stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge
  location.

     Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.

  The name of each log stream is in the following format:

  ` *hosted zone ID*/*edge location code* `

  The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned
  number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the
  International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the
  edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of
  edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the [Route 53 Product Details](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details/) page.

  ### Queries That Are Logged

  Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a
  DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address
  for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the
  cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for
  the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries
  are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that
  resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query
  out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more
  information about how DNS works, see [Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web
  Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/welcome-dns-service.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  ### Log File Format

  For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see
  [Logging DNS Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  ### Pricing

  For information about charges for query logs, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

  ### How to Stop Logging

  If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete the
  query logging configuration. For more information, see
  [DeleteQueryLoggingConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.html).

  Creates a delegation set (a group of four name servers) that can be reused by
  multiple hosted zones that were created by the same Amazon Web Services account.

  You can also create a reusable delegation set that uses the four name servers
  that are associated with an existing hosted zone. Specify the hosted zone ID in

  You can't associate a reusable delegation set with a private hosted zone.

  For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure white label
  name servers, see [Configuring White Label Name Servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/white-label-name-servers.html).

  The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set
  is comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need
  to perform the following steps:

    1. Create a reusable delegation set.

    2. Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less.

    3. Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones.

    4. Change the registrar's name servers to use the name servers for
  the new hosted zones.

    5. Monitor traffic for the website or application.

    6. Change TTLs back to their original values.

  If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set,
  the existing hosted zones can't use any of the name servers that are assigned to
  the reusable delegation set. If one or more hosted zones do use one or more name
  servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the
  following:

    * For small numbers of hosted zones—up to a few hundred—it's
  relatively easy to create reusable delegation sets until you get one that has
  four name servers that don't overlap with any of the name servers in your hosted
  zones.

    * For larger numbers of hosted zones, the easiest solution is to use
  more than one reusable delegation set.

    * For larger numbers of hosted zones, you can also migrate hosted
  zones that have overlapping name servers to hosted zones that don't have
  overlapping name servers, then migrate the hosted zones again to use the
  reusable delegation set.

  Deletes a hosted zone.

  If the hosted zone was created by another service, such as Cloud Map, see
  [Deleting Public Hosted Zones That Were Created by Another Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DeleteHostedZone.html#delete-public-hosted-zone-created-by-another-service)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide* for information about how to delete it.
  (The process is the same for public and private hosted zones that were created
  by another service.)

  If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop routing
  internet traffic to your website or web application, we recommend that you
  delete resource record sets in the hosted zone instead of deleting the hosted
  zone.

  If you delete a hosted zone, you can't undelete it. You must create a new hosted
  zone and update the name servers for your domain registration, which can require
  up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you delegated responsibility for a subdomain
  to a hosted zone and you delete the child hosted zone, you must update the name
  servers in the parent hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone,
  someone could hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using
  your domain name.

  If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can transfer
  DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service. When you transfer DNS service,
  you have to update the name servers for the domain registration. If the domain
  is registered with Route 53, see
  [UpdateDomainNameservers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_UpdateDomainNameservers.html) for information about how to replace Route 53 name servers with name servers for
  the new DNS service. If the domain is registered with another registrar, use the
  method provided by the registrar to update name servers for the domain
  registration. For more information, perform an internet search on "free DNS
  service."

  You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA record and
  NS resource record sets. If the hosted zone contains other resource record sets,
  you must delete them before you can delete the hosted zone. If you try to delete
  a hosted zone that contains other resource record sets, the request fails, and
  Route 53 returns a `HostedZoneNotEmpty` error. For information about deleting
  records from your hosted zone, see
  [ChangeResourceRecordSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_ChangeResourceRecordSets.html).

  To verify that the hosted zone has been deleted, do one of the following:

    * Use the `GetHostedZone` action to request information about the
  hosted zone.

    * Use the `ListHostedZones` action to get a list of the hosted zones
  associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

  For example, to create a hosted zone for exämple.com, you specify ex\344mple.com
  for the domain name. `ListHostedZonesByName` alphabetizes it as:

  `com.ex\344mple.`

  Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.

  `ListResourceRecordSets` returns up to 300 resource record sets at a time in
  ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by the `name` and `type`
  elements.

  ## Sort order

  `ListResourceRecordSets` sorts results first by DNS name with the labels
  reversed, for example:

  `com.example.www.`

  Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name
  contains characters that appear before `.` (decimal 46) in the ASCII table.
  These characters include the following: `! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , -`

  When multiple records have the same DNS name, `ListResourceRecordSets` sorts
  results by the record type.

  ## Specifying where to start listing records

  You can use the name and type elements to specify the resource record set that
  the list begins with:

  ## Definitions

  ### If you do not specify Name or Type

  The results begin with the first resource record set that the hosted zone
  contains.

  ### If you specify Name but not Type

  The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is
  greater than or equal to `Name`.

  ### If you specify Type but not Name

  Amazon Route 53 returns the `InvalidInput` error.

  ### If you specify both Name and Type

  The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is
  greater than or equal to `Name`, and whose type is greater than or equal to
  `Type`.

  ## Resource record sets that are PENDING

  This action returns the most current version of the records. This includes
  records that are `PENDING`, and that are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS
  servers.

  ## Changing resource record sets

  To ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets for a
  hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a `ChangeResourceRecordSets`
  request while you're paging through the results of a `ListResourceRecordSets`
  request. If you do, some pages may display results without the latest changes
  while other pages display results with the latest changes.

  ## Displaying the next page of results

  If a `ListResourceRecordSets` command returns more than one page of results, the
  value of `IsTruncated` is `true`. To display the next page of results, get the
  values of `NextRecordName`, `NextRecordType`, and `NextRecordIdentifier` (if
  any) from the response. Then submit another `ListResourceRecordSets` request,
  and specify those values for `StartRecordName`, `StartRecordType`, and
  `StartRecordIdentifier`.

  Updates the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone that were created
  based on the settings in a specified traffic policy version.

  When you update a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53 continues to respond
  to DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such as example.com) while
  it replaces one group of resource record sets with another. Route 53 performs
  the following operations:

    1. Route 53 creates a new group of resource record sets based on the
  specified traffic policy. This is true regardless of how significant the
  differences are between the existing resource record sets and the new resource
  record sets.

    2. When all of the new resource record sets have been created, Route
  53 starts to respond to DNS queries for the root resource record set name (such
  as example.com) by using the new resource record sets.

    3. Route 53 deletes the old group of resource record sets that are
  associated with the root resource record set name.
