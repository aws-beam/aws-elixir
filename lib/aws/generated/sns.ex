  Amazon Simple Notification Service

  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables
  you to build distributed web-enabled applications.

  Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages
  to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information
  about this product see the [Amazon SNS product page](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/). For detailed information about Amazon SNS
  features and their associated API calls, see the [Amazon SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/).

  For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see [Identity and access management in Amazon
  SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html)
  in the *Amazon SNS Developer Guide.*

  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred
  programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes
  care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying
  requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to
  [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  The result of publishing each message is reported individually in the response.
  Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and
