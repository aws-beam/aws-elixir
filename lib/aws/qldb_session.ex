  The transactional data APIs for Amazon QLDB

  <note> Instead of interacting directly with this API, we recommend that you
  use the Amazon QLDB Driver or the QLDB Shell to execute data transactions
  on a ledger.

  <ul> <li> If you are working with an AWS SDK, use the QLDB Driver. The
  driver provides a high-level abstraction layer above this `qldbsession`
  data plane and manages `SendCommand` API calls for you. For information and
  a list of supported programming languages, see [Getting started with the
  driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-driver.html)
  in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*.

  </li> <li> If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS
  CLI), use the QLDB Shell. The shell is a command line interface that uses
  the QLDB Driver to interact with a ledger. For information, see [Accessing
  Amazon QLDB using the QLDB
  Shell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/data-shell.html).
