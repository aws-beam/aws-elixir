  AWS OpsWorks

  Welcome to the *AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference*. This guide provides
  descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions
  and data types, including common parameters and error codes.

  AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an
  integrated experience for overseeing the complete application lifecycle.
  For information about this product, go to the [AWS
  OpsWorks](http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/) details page.

  **SDKs and CLI**

  The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS
  Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the AWS SDKs to implement
  applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:

  <ul> <li> [AWS
  CLI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for
  Java](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/opsworks/AWSOpsWorksClient.html)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for
  .NET](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/latest/apidocs/html/N_Amazon_OpsWorks.htm)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for PHP
  2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php-2/latest/class-Aws.OpsWorks.OpsWorksClient.html)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for Ruby](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for
  Node.js](http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/sdkforjavascript/)

  </li> <li> [AWS SDK for
  Python(Boto)](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/opsworks.html)

  </li> </ul> **Endpoints**

  AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must
  connect to one of the following endpoints. Stacks can only be accessed or
  managed within the endpoint in which they are created.

  <ul> <li> opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in
  the AWS console)

  </li> <li> opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> </ul> **Chef Versions**

  When you call `CreateStack`, `CloneStack`, or `UpdateStack` we recommend
  you use the `ConfigurationManager` parameter to specify the Chef version.
  The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows
  stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see [Chef
  Versions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html).

  <note> You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We
  recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to Chef 12 as soon as
  possible.
