  The observations to process exist in one or more data files referenced by a

  `MLModel` and the data files referenced by the `DataSource` as information
  sources.

  `CreateBatchPrediction` is an asynchronous operation. In response to
  `CreateBatchPrediction`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns
  and sets the `BatchPrediction` status to `PENDING`. After the `BatchPrediction`
  completes, Amazon ML sets the status to `COMPLETED`.

  Creates a `DataSource` from a database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster.

  A `DataSource` references data that can be used to perform either
  `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

  `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift` is an asynchronous operation. In response to
  `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately

  If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the `Status` parameter to
  `FAILED` and includes an error message in the `Message` attribute of the
  `GetDataSource` operation response.

  The observations should be contained in the database hosted on an Amazon
  Redshift cluster and should be specified by a `SelectSqlQuery` query. Amazon ML
  executes an `Unload` command in Amazon Redshift to transfer the result set of
  the `SelectSqlQuery` query to `S3StagingLocation`.

  After the `DataSource` has been created, it's ready for use in evaluations and
  batch predictions. If you plan to use the `DataSource` to train an `MLModel`,
  the `DataSource` also requires a recipe. A recipe describes how each input
  variable will be used in training an `MLModel`. Will the variable be included or
  excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it
  be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word
  combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions.

  predicted result for each observation to the actual outcome and provides a
  summary so that you know how effective the `MLModel` functions on the test data.
