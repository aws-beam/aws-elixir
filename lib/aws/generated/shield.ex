  your Amazon Web Services account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during
  potential attacks.

  This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF

  You can associate only one `RoleArn` with your subscription. If you submit an
  `AssociateDRTRole` request for an account that already has an associated role,
  the new `RoleArn` will replace the existing `RoleArn`.

  Prior to making the `AssociateDRTRole` request, you must attach the
  `AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy` managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the
  request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at
  [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy). For more information see [Adding and removing IAM identity
  permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html).
  The role must also trust the service principal `drt.shield.amazonaws.com`. For
  more information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html).

  The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting
  this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration

  actions only if explicitly authorized by you.
