  @moduledoc """
  AWS Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
  utilization metrics of your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and Auto
  Scaling groups. It reports whether your resources are optimal, and
  generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the
  performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent
  utilization metric data, as well as projected utilization metric data for
  the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation
  provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage
  patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources,
  and still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more
  information about Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to
  use the service, see the [AWS Compute Optimizer User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/).
