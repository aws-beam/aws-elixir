  AWS Key Management Service

  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web
  service.

  This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically.
  For general information about AWS KMS, see the [ *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).

  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
  programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.).
  The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and
  other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing
  requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For
  more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them,
  see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). 
  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS
  KMS.

  Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2.
  Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such
  as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
  (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

  ## Signing Requests

  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We
  strongly recommend that you *do not* use your AWS account (root) access key ID
  and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID
  and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token
  Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign
  requests.

  All AWS KMS operations require [Signature Version
  4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  ## Logging API Requests

  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related
  events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you
  specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine
  what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and
  so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your
  log files, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

  ## Additional Resources

  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:

    * [AWS Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html)
  - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used
  for accessing AWS.

    * [Temporary Security Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)
  - This section of the *IAM User Guide* describes how to create and use temporary
  security credentials.

  access key ID and a secret access key.

  ## Commonly Used API Operations

  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most
  useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than
  these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

    * `Encrypt`

    * `Decrypt`

    * `GenerateDataKey`

  Cancels the deletion of a customer master key (CMK).

  When this operation succeeds, the key state of the CMK is `Disabled`. To enable

  Connects or reconnects a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.

  The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master
  keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and
  reconnect a custom key store at any time.

  To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at
  least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the
  [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the
  [CreateHsm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html)
  operation. Also, the [ `kmsuser` crypto user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser)
  (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this
  account to log in.

  The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20
  minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for
  it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200
  response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not
  indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of
  the custom key store, use the `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation.

  During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is
  associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure,
  connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the `kmsuser` CU,
  and rotates its password.

  The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons. To find
  the reason, use the `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation and see the
  `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the
  `ConnectionErrorCode`, see `CustomKeyStoresListEntry`.

  To fix the failure, use the `DisconnectCustomKeyStore` operation to disconnect
  the custom key store, correct the error, use the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
  operation if necessary, and then use `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.

  If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see
  [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Adds a grant to a customer master key (CMK).

  The grant allows the grantee principal to use the CMK when the conditions
  specified in the grant are met. When setting permissions, grants are an
  alternative to key policies.

  To create a grant that allows a [cryptographic operation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations)
  only when the request includes a particular [encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context),
  use the `Constraints` parameter. For details, see `GrantConstraints`.

  You can create grants on symmetric and asymmetric CMKs. However, if the grant
  allows an operation that the CMK does not support, `CreateGrant` fails with a
  `ValidationException`.

    * Grants for symmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not
  supported for symmetric CMKs, including `Sign`, `Verify`, and `GetPublicKey`.
  (There are limited exceptions to this rule for legacy operations, but you should

  Creates a unique customer managed [customer master key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master-keys)

  You can use the `CreateKey` operation to create symmetric or asymmetric CMKs.

    * **Symmetric CMKs** contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never
  leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a
  symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are
  typically used to generate [data keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys)
  and [data keys pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-key-pairs).
  For details, see `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair`.

    * **Asymmetric CMKs** can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic
  Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS
  unencrypted. However, you can use the `GetPublicKey` operation to download the
  public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be
  used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs
  with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.

  For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:

  ## Definitions

  ### Asymmetric CMKs

  To create an asymmetric CMK, use the `CustomerMasterKeySpec` parameter to
  specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the `KeyUsage` parameter
  to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and
  verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.

  ### Symmetric CMKs

  When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the
  `CustomerMasterKeySpec` or `KeyUsage` parameters. The default value for
  `CustomerMasterKeySpec`, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and the default value for
  `KeyUsage`, `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.

  ### Imported Key Material

  To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key
  material. To do this, use the `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value of
  `EXTERNAL`. Next, use `GetParametersForImport` operation to get a public key and
  import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use
  `ImportKeyMaterial` with your import token to import the key material. For
  step-by-step instructions, see [Importing Key Material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html)
  in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* *. You cannot import the
  key material into an asymmetric CMK.

  ### Custom Key Stores

  To create a symmetric CMK in a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html),
  use the `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to specify the custom key store. You must
  also use the `Origin` parameter with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The AWS CloudHSM
  cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two
  active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.

  You cannot create an asymmetric CMK in a custom key store. For information about
  custom key stores in AWS KMS see [Using Custom Key Stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* *.

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a
  different AWS account.

  **Required permissions**:
  [kms:CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (IAM policy). To use the `Tags` parameter,
  [kms:TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
  (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see [Allow a user to create
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policy-example-create-key)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a AWS KMS customer master key (CMK)
  using any of the following operations:

    * `Encrypt`

    * `GenerateDataKey`

    * `GenerateDataKeyPair`

    * `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`

    * `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`

  You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a
  symmetric or asymmetric CMK.

  When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption
  algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about
  symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS
  KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt
  ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the [AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/) or
  [Amazon S3 client-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).
  These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.

  If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the `KeyId` parameter is
  optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the
  symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation
  by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was
  encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the CMK
  is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the `KeyId` parameter to
  specify a CMK, AWS KMS only uses the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was
  encrypted under a different CMK, the `Decrypt` operation fails. This practice
  ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.

  Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the
  `Decrypt` operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies.
  Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user `Decrypt`
  permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
  CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it.
  If you must use an IAM policy for `Decrypt` permissions, limit the user to
  particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. For details, see [Best practices for IAM
  policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policies-best-practices)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For

  Deletes the specified alias.

  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the
  aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the
  response from the `DescribeKey` operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use
  the `ListAliases` operation.

  Each CMK can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a CMK, use
  `DeleteAlias` to delete the current alias and `CreateAlias` to create a new
  alias. To associate an existing alias with a different customer master key

  The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS [customer master keys

  `ScheduleKeyDeletion` operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to
  delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to
  manually [delete the orphaned key material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key)

  Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK).

  The `Encrypt` operation has two primary use cases:

    * You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a
  personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.

    * You can use the `Encrypt` operation to move encrypted data from
  one AWS Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use
  the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the `Encrypt`
  operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you
  can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When
  necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the encrypted data
  entirely within in Region B.

  You don't need to use the `Encrypt` operation to encrypt a data key. The
  `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair` operations return a plaintext data
  key and an encrypted copy of that data key.

  When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in
  the encryption operation. The CMK must have a `KeyUsage` value of
  `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.` To find the `KeyUsage` of a CMK, use the `DescribeKey`
  operation.

  If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional
  security to your encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`
  when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a
  case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to
  decrypt fails with an `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more information, see
  [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption
  algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.

  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record
  the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to
  provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the
  CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt
  operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK
  and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

  ## How to use your data key

  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your
  application. You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption
  library, such as the [AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/), the
  [Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb-encryption-client/latest/devguide/),
  or [Amazon S3 client-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html)
  to do these tasks for you.

  To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

    1. Use the `GenerateDataKey` operation to get a data key.

    2. Use the plaintext data key (in the `Plaintext` field of the
  response) to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext data
  key from memory.

    3. Store the encrypted data key (in the `CiphertextBlob` field of
  the response) with the encrypted data.

  To decrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

    1. Use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted data key.
  The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.

    2. Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of AWS KMS,
  then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different
  AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId`

  Generates a unique asymmetric data key pair.

  The `GenerateDataKeyPair` operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext
  private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric
  CMK you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform asymmetric
  cryptography outside of AWS KMS.

  `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes

  Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK.

  Unlike the private key of a asymmetric CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS
  unencrypted, callers with `kms:GetPublicKey` permission can download the public
  key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public key to allow others to
  encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of AWS KMS. For information about
  symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key
  within AWS KMS by calling the `Encrypt`, `ReEncrypt`, or `Verify` operations
  with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS
  KMS, you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are
  part of every AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that
  cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For
  details, see [Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations).

  To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, `GetPublicKey` returns
  important information about the public key in the response, including:

    *
  [CustomerMasterKeySpec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-CustomerMasterKeySpec): The type of key material in the public key, such as `RSA_4096` or
  `ECC_NIST_P521`.

    *
  [KeyUsage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage):
  Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.

    *
  [EncryptionAlgorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms) or
  [SigningAlgorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms):
  A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.

  Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is
  crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used
  improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used
  encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption
  algorithm that is not supported by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as
  using the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.

  After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can [reimport the same key
  material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html#reimport-key-material)
  into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material.

  You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric CMK or on any CMK in a

  Before using this operation, call `GetParametersForImport`. Its response
  includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key
  material. Then, submit the import token from the same `GetParametersForImport`
  response.

  When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

    * The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its `Origin`
  must be `EXTERNAL`.

  To create a CMK with no key material, call `CreateKey` and set the value of its
  `Origin` parameter to `EXTERNAL`. To get the `Origin` of a CMK, call
  `DescribeKey`.)

    * The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the
  key material, call `GetParametersForImport`.

    * The import token that `GetParametersForImport` returned. You must
  use a public key and token from the same `GetParametersForImport` response.

    * Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an
  expiration date, AWS KMS deletes the key material from the CMK on the specified
  date, and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you must reimport the
  same key material. The only way to change an expiration date is by reimporting
  the same key material and specifying a new expiration date.

  When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes from
  `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the CMK.

  If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem. If the

  Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS.

  data is encrypted, such as when you [manually rotate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html#rotate-keys-manually)
  a CMK or change the CMK that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to
  reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the [encryption context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  of a ciphertext.

  The `ReEncrypt` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an
  AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as `Encrypt` or `GenerateDataKey`. It
  can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an
  [asymmetric CMK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks)
  outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other
  libraries, such as the [AWS Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/) or
  [Amazon S3 client-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).
  These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.

  When you use the `ReEncrypt` operation, you need to provide information for the
  decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.

    * If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must
  use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to identify the CMK that encrypted the
  ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This
  information is required to decrypt the data.

    * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the
  `SourceKeyId` parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from
  metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds
  durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt
  ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK
  ID. However, specifying the source CMK is always recommended as a best practice.
  When you use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS uses only the
  CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the
  `ReEncrypt` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you
  intend.

    * To reencrypt the data, you must use the `DestinationKeyId`
  parameter specify the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You
  can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an
  asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm
  that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.

  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record
  the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to
  provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the
  CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt
  operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For

  when the waiting period expires, `ScheduleKeyDeletion` deletes the CMK from AWS
  KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the
  associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key
  material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key)
  from the cluster and its backups.

  For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see [Deleting Customer Master
  Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/deleting-keys.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
  details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in
  the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Creates a [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) for a message or message digest by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK.

  To verify the signature, use the `Verify` operation, or use the public key in
  the same asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and
  asymmetric CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such
  as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key
  (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a
  message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with
  that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was
  signed.

  To use the `Sign` operation, provide the following information:

    * Use the `KeyId` parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a
  `KeyUsage` value of `SIGN_VERIFY`. To get the `KeyUsage` value of a CMK, use the
  `DescribeKey` operation. The caller must have `kms:Sign` permission on the CMK.

    * Use the `Message` parameter to specify the message or message
  digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger
  message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest
  in the `Message` parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or
  a digest, use the `MessageType` parameter.

    * Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.

  When signing a message, be sure to record the CMK and the signing algorithm.
  This information is required to verify the signature.

  To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the `Verify`
  operation. Or use the `GetPublicKey` operation to download the public key and
  then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
  details, see [How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in
  the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different
  AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the `KeyId`
  parameter.

  Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK).

  Each alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have
  multiple aliases. The alias and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and
  region.

  The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both
  asymmetric), and they must have the same key usage (`ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` or
  `SIGN_VERIFY`). This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If
  you must assign an alias to a different type of CMK, use `DeleteAlias` to delete
  the old alias and `CreateAlias` to create a new alias.

  You cannot use `UpdateAlias` to change an alias name. To change an alias name,
  use `DeleteAlias` to delete the old alias and `CreateAlias` to create a new
  alias.

  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete
  the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in
  the response from the `DescribeKey` operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in
  the account, use the `ListAliases` operation.

  Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the `Sign` operation.

  Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the
  specified CMK and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was
  signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the `SignatureValid` field in
  the response is `True`. If the signature verification fails, the `Verify`
  operation fails with an `KMSInvalidSignatureException` exception.

  A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK.
  The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK.

  To verify a digital signature, you can use the `Verify` operation. Specify the

  in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature
  outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the `Verify` operation is that it is
  performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is
