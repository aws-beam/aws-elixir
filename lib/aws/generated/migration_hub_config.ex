  The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working
  with your Migration Hub home region.

  You can use these APIs to determine a home region, as well as to create and work
  with controls that describe the home region.

    * You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
  associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
  `HomeRegionNotSetException` error is returned.

    * API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
  permitted outside of your home region.

    * If you call a write API outside the home region, an
  `InvalidInputException` is returned.

    * You can call `GetHomeRegion` action to obtain the account's
  Migration Hub home region.

  For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub
  Home Region API reference.
