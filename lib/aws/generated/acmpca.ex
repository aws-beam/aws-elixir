  This is the *ACM Private CA API Reference*.

  It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and
  data types involved in creating and managing private certificate authorities
  (CA) for your organization.

  The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the
  XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API
  that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
  more information, see [AWS SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).  Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of
  times the operation can be called per second. ACM Private CA throttles API
  requests at different rates depending on the operation. Throttling means that
  ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds
  the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When a request is
  throttled, ACM Private CA returns a
  [ThrottlingException](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html)
  error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs.

  To see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request a quota
  increase, log into your AWS account and visit the [Service Quotas](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) console.

  You must specify the CA configuration, an optional configuration for Online
  Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and/or a certificate revocation list (CRL),

  size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that
  the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The OCSP configuration can
  optionally specify a custom URL for the OCSP responder. The CRL configuration

  Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA

  [UpdateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCertificateAuthority.html)

  Imports a signed private CA certificate into ACM Private CA.

  This action is used when you are using a chain of trust whose root is located
  outside ACM Private CA. Before you can call this action, the following
  preparations must in place:

    1. In ACM Private CA, call the
  [CreateCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCertificateAuthority.html) action to create the private CA that you plan to back with the imported
  certificate.

    2. Call the
  [GetCertificateAuthorityCsr](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_GetCertificateAuthorityCsr.html)
  action to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).

    3. Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by either an
  on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.

    4. Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and
  the certificate chain to your working directory.

  ACM Private CA supports three scenarios for installing a CA certificate:

    * Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by ACM Private CA.

    * Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is
  hosted by ACM Private CA.

    * Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is
  externally hosted.

  The following additional requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.

    * Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.

    * A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.

    * Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate
  that you are importing.

    * Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The
  subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last.
  The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come
  next, and so on until your chain is built.

    * The chain must be PEM-encoded.

    * The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.

    * The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.

  *Enforcement of Critical Constraints*

  ACM Private CA allows the following extensions to be marked critical in the
  imported CA certificate or chain.

    * Basic constraints (*must* be marked critical)

    * Subject alternative names

    * Key usage

    * Extended key usage

    * Authority key identifier

    * Subject key identifier

    * Issuer alternative name

    * Subject directory attributes

    * Subject information access

    * Certificate policies

    * Policy mappings

    * Inhibit anyPolicy

  ACM Private CA rejects the following extensions when they are marked critical in
  an imported CA certificate or chain.

  Adds one or more tags to your private CA.

  Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your AWS resources.
  Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You specify the private CA on
  input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify the tag by using a
  key-value pair. You can apply a tag to just one private CA if you want to
  identify a specific characteristic of that CA, or you can apply the same tag to
  multiple private CAs if you want to filter for a common relationship among those
  CAs. To remove one or more tags, use the
  [UntagCertificateAuthority](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_UntagCertificateAuthority.html) action. Call the
  [ListTags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_ListTags.html)
  action to see what tags are associated with your CA.

  Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate authority (CA).

  Your private CA must be in the `ACTIVE` or `DISABLED` state before you can
