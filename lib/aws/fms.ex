  Firewall Manager provides the following types of policies:

  <ul> <li> A Shield Advanced policy, which applies Shield Advanced
  protection to specified accounts and resources

  </li> <li> An AWS WAF policy (type WAFV2), which defines rule groups to run
  first in the corresponding AWS WAF web ACL and rule groups to run last in
  the web ACL.

  </li> <li> An AWS WAF Classic policy (type WAF), which defines a rule
  group.

  </li> <li> A security group policy, which manages VPC security groups
  across your AWS organization.

  </li> </ul> Each policy is specific to one of the types. If you want to
  enforce more than one policy type across accounts, create multiple
  policies. You can create multiple policies for each type.

  You must be subscribed to Shield Advanced to create a Shield Advanced
  policy. For more information about subscribing to Shield Advanced, see
  [CreateSubscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/DDOSAPIReference/API_CreateSubscription.html).
