defmodule AWS.IoTJobsDataPlane do
  @moduledoc """
  AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote
  operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS
  IoT.

  For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to download
  and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or
  perform remote troubleshooting operations.

  To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote
  operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that should
  perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
  both.

  AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The
  target starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document,
  performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT.
  The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific
  target and for all the targets of the job
