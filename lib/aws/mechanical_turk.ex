  The `CreateHIT` operation creates a new Human Intelligence Task (HIT). The
  new HIT is made available for Workers to find and accept on the Amazon
  Mechanical Turk website.

  This operation allows you to specify a new HIT by passing in values for the
  properties of the HIT, such as its title, reward amount and number of
  assignments. When you pass these values to `CreateHIT`, a new HIT is
  created for you, with a new `HITTypeID`. The HITTypeID can be used to
  create additional HITs in the future without needing to specify common
  parameters such as the title, description and reward amount each time.

  An alternative way to create HITs is to first generate a HITTypeID using
  the `CreateHITType` operation and then call the `CreateHITWithHITType`
  operation. This is the recommended best practice for Requesters who are
  creating large numbers of HITs.

  CreateHIT also supports several ways to provide question data: by providing
  a value for the `Question` parameter that fully specifies the contents of
  the HIT, or by providing a `HitLayoutId` and associated
  `HitLayoutParameters`.
