  AWS CloudTrail

  This is the CloudTrail API Reference.

  It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
  errors for CloudTrail.

  CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and
  delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the
  identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP address,
  the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.

  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of
  libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java,
  Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create
  programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of
  cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests
  automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and
  install them, see the [Tools for Amazon Web Services page](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  See the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
  for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in
  the log files.

  Adds one or more tags to a trail, up to a limit of 50.

  the same name but different values. If you specify a key without a value, the
  tag will be created with the specified key and a value of null. You can tag a
  trail that applies to all AWS Regions only from the Region in which the trail

  Configures an event selector for your trail.

  Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event settings
  for your trail. By default, trails created without specific event selectors will
  be configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.

  When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors
  in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the
  trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't match any event
  selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

  Example

    1. You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you
  want write-only events.

    2. The EC2 `GetConsoleOutput` and `RunInstances` API operations
  occur in your account.

    3. CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event
  selectors.

    4. The `RunInstances` is a write-only event and it matches your
  event selector. The trail logs the event.

    5. The `GetConsoleOutput` is a read-only event but it doesn't match
  your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

  The `PutEventSelectors` operation must be called from the region in which the
  trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` is thrown.

  You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
  information, see [Logging Data and Management Events for Trails
