  Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray.

  The [X-Ray SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html) generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in batches. A
  segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress segment, or an array
  of subsegments.

  Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document
  schema, see [Amazon Web Services X-Ray Segment
  Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide*.

  ## Required segment document fields

    * `name` - The name of the service that handled the request.

    * `id` - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments
  in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.

    * `trace_id` - A unique identifier that connects all segments and
  subsegments originating from a single client request.

    * `start_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in
  floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example,
  `1480615200.010` or `1.480615200010E9`.

    * `end_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For
  example, `1480615200.090` or `1.480615200090E9`. Specify either an `end_time` or
  `in_progress`.

    * `in_progress` - Set to `true` instead of specifying an `end_time`
  to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an
  in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a
  long time to serve, to trace that the request was received. When the response is
  sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.

  A `trace_id` consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example,
  1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:

  ## Trace ID Format

    * The version number, for instance, `1`.

    * The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8
  hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is
  `1480615200` seconds, or `58406520` in hexadecimal.

    * A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24
  hexadecimal digits.
