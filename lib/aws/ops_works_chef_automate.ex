  AWS OpsWorks CM

  AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and
  manages configuration management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to
  create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for
  Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to
  manage.

  **Glossary of terms**

  <ul> <li> **Server**: A configuration management server that can be
  highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon
  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS
  services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load
  Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager
  that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not
  start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until
  they are deleted.

  </li> <li> **Engine**: The engine is the specific configuration manager
  that you want to use. Valid values in this release include `ChefAutomate`
  and `Puppet`.

  </li> <li> **Backup**: This is an application-level backup of the data that
  the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for
  backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of
  a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.

  </li> <li> **Events**: Events are always related to a server. Events are
  written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are
  created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a
  server, the server's events are also deleted.

  </li> <li> **Account attributes**: Every account has attributes that are
  assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store
  information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your
  customer account.

  </li> </ul> **Endpoints**

  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must
  connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be
  accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.

  <ul> <li> opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> <li> opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

  </li> </ul> **Throttling limits**

  All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10
  requests per second.

  Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to
  disassociate a node, see `DisassociateNode`.

  On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to `knife bootstrap`.

  Example (Chef): `aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name *MyServer*
  --node-name *MyManagedNode* --engine-attributes
  "Name=*CHEF_ORGANIZATION*,Value=default"
  "Name=*CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY*,Value=*public-key-pem*"`

  On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the `puppet cert
  sign` command that signs a Puppet node CSR.

  Example (Chef): `aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name *MyServer*
  --node-name *MyManagedNode* --engine-attributes
  "Name=*PUPPET_NODE_CSR*,Value=*csr-pem*"`

  A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a `HEALTHY`
  state. Otherwise, an `InvalidStateException` is thrown. A
  `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server does not exist. A
  `ValidationException` is raised when parameters of the request are not
  valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling
  configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a
  server's instance.

  Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the
  `BACKING_UP` state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup
  can be created.

  Backups can be created for servers in `RUNNING`, `HEALTHY`, and `UNHEALTHY`
  states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.

  This operation is asynchronous.

  A `LimitExceededException` is thrown when the maximum number of manual
  backups is reached. An `InvalidStateException` is thrown when the server is
  not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A
  `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when the server is not found. A
  `ValidationException` is thrown when parameters of the request are not
  valid.

  Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when
  it is in the `HEALTHY` state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10
  servers.

  This operation is asynchronous.

  A `LimitExceededException` is thrown when you have created the maximum
  number of servers (10). A `ResourceAlreadyExistsException` is thrown when a
  server with the same name already exists in the account. A
  `ResourceNotFoundException` is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is
  not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A `ValidationException`
  is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

  If you do not specify a security group by adding the `SecurityGroupIds`
  parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.

  *Chef Automate:* The default security group opens the Chef server to the
  world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH
  access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.

  *Puppet Enterprise:* The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443,
  4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks
  enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.

  By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend
  that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP
  addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open
  Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.
