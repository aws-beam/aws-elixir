  AWS Directory Service

  AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup
  and run directories in the AWS cloud, or connect your AWS resources with an
  existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides
  detailed information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types,
  parameters, and errors. For information about AWS Directory Services
  features, see [AWS Directory
  Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the [AWS Directory
  Service Administration
  Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html).

  <note> AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS,
  Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
  access to AWS Directory Service and other AWS services. For more
  information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them,
  see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
