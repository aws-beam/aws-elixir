  domain. Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and
  automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name
  servers.

  </li> <li> Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew
  automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so
  you can choose whether to renew the registration.

  contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org
  domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). If you
  don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS queries return the information that
  you entered for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts.

  53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html)

  account to another, see
  [TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_TransferDomainToAnotherAwsAccount.html).

  Registrar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-from-route-53.html)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  </li> </ul> If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service
  provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you transfer your DNS
  service to Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer
  your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you
  purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the
  previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end
  your DNS service at any time.

  <important> If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service
  provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another
  provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the
  domain might become unavailable.
