  Amazon Textract detects and analyzes text in documents and converts it into
  machine-readable text.

  This is the API reference documentation for Amazon Textract.
  """

  @doc """
  Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.

  The types of information returned are as follows:

    * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned
  in two `Block` objects, each of type `KEY_VALUE_SET`: a KEY `Block` object and a
  VALUE `Block` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and
  value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value.

    * Table and table cell data. A TABLE `Block` object contains
  information about a detected table. A CELL `Block` object is returned for each
  cell in a table.

    * Lines and words of text. A LINE `Block` object contains one or
  more WORD `Block` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document
  are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of
  `FeatureTypes`).

  Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be
  detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT `Block` object contains
  information about a selection element, including the selection status.

  You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the
  `FeatureTypes` list.

  The output is returned in a list of `Block` objects.

  `AnalyzeDocument` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents
  asynchronously, use `StartDocumentAnalysis`.

  Detects text in the input document.

  Amazon Textract can detect lines of text and the words that make up a line of
  text. The input document must be an image in JPEG or PNG format.
  `DetectDocumentText` returns the detected text in an array of `Block` objects.

  Each document page has as an associated `Block` of type PAGE. Each PAGE `Block`
  object is the parent of LINE `Block` objects that represent the lines of
  detected text on a page. A LINE `Block` object is a parent for each word that
  makes up the line. Words are represented by `Block` objects of type WORD.

  `DetectDocumentText` is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents
  asynchronously, use `StartDocumentTextDetection`.

  Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that analyzes
  text in a document.

  You start asynchronous text analysis by calling `StartDocumentAnalysis`, which
  returns a job identifier (`JobId`). When the text analysis operation finishes,
  Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification
  Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered in the initial call to
  `StartDocumentAnalysis`. To get the results of the text-detection operation,
  first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is
  `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call `GetDocumentAnalysis`, and pass the job identifier
  (`JobId`) from the initial call to `StartDocumentAnalysis`.

  `GetDocumentAnalysis` returns an array of `Block` objects. The following types
  of information are returned:

    * Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned
  in two `Block` objects, each of type `KEY_VALUE_SET`: a KEY `Block` object and a
  VALUE `Block` object. For example, *Name: Ana Silva Carolina* contains a key and
  value. *Name:* is the key. *Ana Silva Carolina* is the value.

    * Table and table cell data. A TABLE `Block` object contains
  information about a detected table. A CELL `Block` object is returned for each
  cell in a table.

    * Lines and words of text. A LINE `Block` object contains one or
  more WORD `Block` objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document
  are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of
  the `StartDocumentAnalysis` `FeatureTypes` input parameter).

  Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be
  detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT `Block` object contains
  information about a selection element, including the selection status.

  Use the `MaxResults` parameter to limit the number of blocks that are returned.
  If there are more results than specified in `MaxResults`, the value of
  `NextToken` in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting
  the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call
  `GetDocumentAnalysis`, and populate the `NextToken` request parameter with the
  token value that's returned from the previous call to `GetDocumentAnalysis`.
