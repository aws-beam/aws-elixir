  Amazon Macie Classic

  Amazon Macie Classic is a security service that uses machine learning to
  automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS. Macie
  Classic recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable
  information (PII) or intellectual property, and provides you with
  dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how this data is being
  accessed or moved. For more information, see the [Amazon Macie Classic User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/userguide/what-is-macie.html).

  A new Amazon Macie is now available with significant design improvements
  and additional features, at a lower price and in most AWS Regions. We
  encourage you to explore and use the new and improved features, and benefit
  from the reduced cost. To learn about features and pricing for the new
  Amazon Macie, see [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/).
