  ` This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and other details about each
  of the actions and data types for Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor
  Spaces (Refactor Spaces).

  The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
  Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API
  that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
  more information, see [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).

  To share Refactor Spaces environments with other Amazon Web Services accounts or
  with Organizations and their OUs, use Resource Access Manager's
  `CreateResourceShare` API. See
  [CreateResourceShare](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/APIReference/API_CreateResourceShare.html)

  Creates an Amazon Web Services Migration Hub Refactor Spaces route.

  The account owner of the service resource is always the environment owner,
  regardless of which account creates the route. Routes target a service in the
  application. If an application does not have any routes, then the first route
  must be created as a `DEFAULT` `RouteType`.

  When you create a route, Refactor Spaces configures the Amazon API Gateway to
  send traffic to the target service as follows:

    * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a
  private IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic using the API Gateway VPC
  link.

    * If the service has a URL endpoint, and the endpoint resolves to a
  public IP address, Refactor Spaces routes traffic over the public internet.

    * If the service has an Lambda function endpoint, then Refactor
  Spaces configures the Lambda function's resource policy to allow the
  application's API Gateway to invoke the function.

  A one-time health check is performed on the service when the route is created.
  If the health check fails, the route transitions to `FAILED`, and no traffic is
  sent to the service.

  For Lambda functions, the Lambda function state is checked. If the function is
  not active, the function configuration is updated so that Lambda resources are
  provisioned. If the Lambda state is `Failed`, then the route creation fails. For
  more information, see the [GetFunctionConfiguration's State response parameter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunctionConfiguration.html#SSS-GetFunctionConfiguration-response-State)
  in the *Lambda Developer Guide*.

  For public URLs, a connection is opened to the public endpoint. If the URL is
  not reachable, the health check fails. For private URLs, a target group is
  created and the target group health check is run.

  The `HealthCheckProtocol`, `HealthCheckPort`, and `HealthCheckPath` are the same
  protocol, port, and path specified in the URL or health URL, if used. All other
  settings use the default values, as described in [Health checks for your target groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/target-group-health-checks.html).
  The health check is considered successful if at least one target within the
  target group transitions to a healthy state.

  Services can have HTTP or HTTPS URL endpoints. For HTTPS URLs, publicly-signed
  certificates are supported. Private Certificate Authorities (CAs) are permitted
  only if the CA's domain is publicly resolvable.
