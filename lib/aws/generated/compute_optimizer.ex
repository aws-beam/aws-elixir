  Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization
  metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as Amazon EC2
  instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions, and Amazon EBS
  volumes.

  It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization
  recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your
  workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in
  addition to projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you
  can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance
  trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move
  or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity
  requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, including the
  required permissions to use the service, see the [Compute Optimizer User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/).
