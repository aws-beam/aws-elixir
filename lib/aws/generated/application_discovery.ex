  AWS Application Discovery Service

  AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects.

  It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
  dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the
  [AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/). Application Discovery
  Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your
  on-premises servers:

    * **Agentless discovery** is recommended for environments that use
  VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each
  host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.

      * Agentless discovery gathers server information
  regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for
  initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.

      * Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
  network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.

    * **Agent-based discovery** collects a richer set of data than
  agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you
  install on one or more hosts in your data center.

      * The agent captures infrastructure and application
  information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance
  information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.

      * The information collected by agents is secured at rest
  and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

    * **AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions** integrate with Application
  Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises
  environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or
  discovery agent.

      * Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS
  Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery
  Service database using the public API.

      * In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub
  and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track
  migrations.

  ## Recommendations

  We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and
  whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run
  agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to
  complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents
  on select hosts to collect additional information.

  ## Working With This Guide

  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of
  the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each
  action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can
  use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming
  language or platform that you're using. For more information, see [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).

     Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before
  you call any of these APIs.

     You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
  associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
  `HomeRegionNotSetException` error is returned.

     API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
  permitted outside of your home region.

     Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could
  change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an `InvalidInputException` is
  returned.

     You must call `GetHomeRegion` to obtain the latest Migration Hub
  home region.

  This guide is intended for use with the [AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/).

  All data is handled according to the [AWS Privacy Policy](http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). You can operate Application Discovery
  Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.

  Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises
  environment directly into AWS Migration Hub without having to use the
  Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery Connector or
  Discovery Agent.

  This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly
  from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as
  applications and track their migration status.

  To start an import request, do this:

    1. Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV)
  import template, which you can find here:
  [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv).     2. Fill out the template with your server and application data.

    3. Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note
  of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.

    4. Use the console or the `StartImportTask` command with the AWS CLI
  or one of the AWS SDKs to import the records from your file.

  For more information, including step-by-step procedures, see [Migration Hub
  Import](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-import.html)

  There are limits to the number of import tasks you can create (and delete) in an
  AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Application Discovery Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/ads_service_limits.html)
