  Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match.
  A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then
  matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all
  players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.

  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the
  proposed match are placed into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This is a
  trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket.
  Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all
  other acceptances result in an error.

  To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more
  players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking
  tickets advance to status `PLACING`, where a new game session is created
  for the match.

  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before
  a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets
  are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players
  rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to `SEARCHING` to find a
  new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the
  ticket status is set to `CANCELLED`, and processing is terminated. A new
  matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

  **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
  server groups.**

  Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host
  gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client
  service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game
  session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server,
  places it in `CLAIMED` status for 60 seconds, and returns connection
  information that players can use to connect to the game server.

  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify
  a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ
  placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game
  server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player
  information.

  When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is
  returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains `AVAILABLE`
  while the claim status is set to `CLAIMED` for up to 60 seconds. This time
  period gives the game server time to update its status to `UTILIZED` (using
  `UpdateGameServer`) once players join. If the game server's status is not
  updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and
  is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a
  fixed value and is not configurable.

  If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the
  following cases:

  <ul> <li> If the game server utilization status is `UTILIZED`.

  </li> <li> If the game server claim status is `CLAIMED`.

  </li> </ul> <note> When claiming a specific game server, this request will
  succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in `DRAINING`
  status. To avoid this, first check the instance status by calling
  `DescribeGameServerInstances`.

  Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID
  in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a
  fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to
  another, such as when updating your game build.

  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases:
  simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal
  alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing
  players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias
  when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players
  to an upgrade site.

  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and
  optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a
  fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is
  returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to
  another fleet by calling `UpdateAlias`.

  Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary
  files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use with
  Amazon GameLift.

  <important> When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend
  using the AWS CLI command **
  [upload-build](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/gamelift/upload-build.html)
  **. This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files
  from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates
  a new build resource.

  </important> The `CreateBuild` operation can used in the following
  scenarios:

  <ul> <li> To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3
  location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you
  must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With permissions
  in place, call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name, operating system,
  and the S3 storage location of your game build.

  </li> <li> To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location.
  To use this option, first call `CreateBuild` and specify a build name and
  operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also
  returns an S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the
  credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified S3
  location. For more information, see [Uploading
  Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UploadingObjects.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 Developer Guide*. Build files can be uploaded to the
  GameLift S3 location once only; that can't be updated.

  </li> </ul> If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with
  a unique build ID and places it in `INITIALIZED` status. A build must be in
  `READY` status before you can create fleets with it.

  Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game
  builds or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of
  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host
  multiple game sessions. When creating a fleet, you choose the hardware
  specifications, set some configuration options, and specify the game server
  to deploy on the new fleet.

  To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2
  instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID for your
  game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a runtime
  configuration, which determines how game servers will run on each instance
  in the fleet.

  If the `CreateFleet` call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the
  following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet
  status or by monitoring fleet creation events:

  <ul> <li> Creates a fleet resource. Status: `NEW`.

  </li> <li> Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be
  accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.

  </li> <li> Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which
  triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.

  </li> <li> Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance
  and installs it. Statuses: `DOWNLOADING`, `VALIDATING`, `BUILDING`.

  </li> <li> Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet
  is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon
  GameLift staggers each process launch by a few seconds. Status:
  `ACTIVATING`.

  </li> <li> Sets the fleet's status to `ACTIVE` as soon as one server
  process is ready to host a game session.

  **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
  server groups.**

  Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a
  collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates
  the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account,
  and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of
  your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics
  and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

  Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:

  <ul> <li> An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon
  EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see [
  Launching an Instance from a Launch
  Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html)
  in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  </li> <li> An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to
  allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group.
  For more information, see [Create IAM roles for cross-service
  interaction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html)
  in the *GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

  </li> </ul> To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name,
  IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance
  types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and
  minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an
  Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ
  metric.

  Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are
  created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's
  configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a
  game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy
  settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind
  that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by
  GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for
  availability and cost.

  Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This operation creates a
  game session record and assigns an available server process in the
  specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an `ACTIVE`
  status before a game session can be created in it.

  To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate
  a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also
  provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If
  successful, a `GameSession` object is returned containing the game session
  properties and other settings you specified.

  **Idempotency tokens.** You can add a token that uniquely identifies game
  session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests
  are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are
  processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All
  response values are the same with the exception of game session status,
  which may change.

  **Resource creation limits.** If you are creating a game session on a fleet
  with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a
  creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the
  policy for this new game session request.

  **Player acceptance policy.** By default, newly created game sessions are
  open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using
  `UpdateGameSession` to change the game session's player session creation
  policy.

  Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions.
  A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a
  list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait
  in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game
  sessions on fleets in multiple Regions. To add placement requests to a
  queue, call `StartGameSessionPlacement` and reference the queue name.

  **Destination order.** When processing a request for a game session, Amazon
  GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available
  resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is
  determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden
  when a game session placement request provides player latency information.
  Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize
  destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result
  placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the
  best possible gameplay experience.

  **Player latency policies.** For placement requests containing player
  latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual
  players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a
  destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not
  placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a
  policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are
  enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency
  cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for
  example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60
  seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.

  To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of
  destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies. If successful, a
  new queue object is returned.

  Defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. A
  matchmaking configuration sets out guidelines for matching players and
  getting the matches into games. You can set up multiple matchmaking
  configurations to handle the scenarios needed for your game. Each
  matchmaking ticket (`StartMatchmaking` or `StartMatchBackfill`) specifies a
  configuration for the match and provides player attributes to support the

  To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the
  following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate
  players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when
  placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for
  a matchmaking attempt.

  Establishes a VPC peering connection between a virtual private cloud (VPC)

  enables the game servers on your fleet to communicate directly with other
  AWS resources. You can peer with VPCs in any AWS account that you have

  GameLift fleets. You cannot peer with VPCs that are in different Regions.

  **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game

  Terminates a game server group and permanently deletes the game server
  group record. You have several options for how these resources are impacted
  when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete
  operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:

  <ul> <li> The game server group

  </li> <li> The corresponding Auto Scaling group

  </li> <li> All game servers that are currently running in the group

  </li> </ul> To delete a game server group, identify the game server group
  to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server
  groups can only be deleted if they are in `ACTIVE` or `ERROR` status.

  If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off.
  The game server group status is changed to `DELETE_SCHEDULED`, which
  prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling
  activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered,
  GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete
  operations fail, the game server group is placed in `ERROR` status.

  GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.

  **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
  server groups.**

  Retrieves status information about the Amazon EC2 instances associated with
  a GameLift FleetIQ game server group. Use this operation to detect when
  instances are active or not available to host new game servers. If you are
  looking for instance configuration information, call
  `DescribeGameServerGroup` or access the corresponding Auto Scaling group
  properties.

  To request status for all instances in the game server group, provide a
  game server group ID only. To request status for specific instances,
  provide the game server group ID and one or more instance IDs. Use the
  pagination parameters to retrieve results in sequential segments. If
  successful, a collection of `GameServerInstance` objects is returned.

  This operation is not designed to be called with every game server claim
  request; this practice can cause you to exceed your API limit, which
  results in errors. Instead, as a best practice, cache the results and
  refresh your cache no more than once every 10 seconds.

  Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used
  to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An
  active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and
  automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is
  reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and
  rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage
  fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based
  policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.

  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same
  time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based
  scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple
  auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.

  You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling
  `StopFleetActions` with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling
  policies, call `StartFleetActions` with the same fleet action. To stop just
  one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy
  with `DeleteScalingPolicy`.

  Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in [Set Up Fleet Automatic
  Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html).

  **Target-based policy**

  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions.
  This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to
  host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer;
  it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at
  current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer
  size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to
  maintain that target.

  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has
  the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells
  Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity
  falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new
  instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.

  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and
  set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track
  (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a `TargetConfiguration` object
  with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a
  successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is
  automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's
  auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in
  force once the fleet actions are restarted.

  **Rule-based policy**

  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value,
  and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a
  rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics.
  Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much),
  so you need one policy for each type of action.

  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage
  of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce
  the fleet capacity by 10%."

  A policy's rule statement has the following structure:

  If `[MetricName]` is `[ComparisonOperator]` `[Threshold]` for
  `[EvaluationPeriods]` minutes, then `[ScalingAdjustmentType]` to/by
  `[ScalingAdjustment]`.

  To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:

  If `[PercentIdleInstances]` is `[GreaterThanThreshold]` `[20]` for `[15]`
  minutes, then `[PercentChangeInCapacity]` to/by `[10]`.

  To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name
  and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter
  values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy
  name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as
  they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are
  temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet
  actions are restarted.

  Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the
  game server is ready to host gameplay and players. This operation is called
  by a game server process that is running on an instance in a game server
  group. Registering game servers enables GameLift FleetIQ to track available
  game servers and enables game clients and services to claim a game server
  for a new game session.

  To register a game server, identify the game server group and instance
  where the game server is running, and provide a unique identifier for the
  game server. You can also include connection and game server data. When a
  game client or service requests a game server by calling `ClaimGameServer`,
  this information is returned in the response.

  Once a game server is successfully registered, it is put in status
  `AVAILABLE`. A request to register a game server may fail if the instance
  it is running on is in the process of shutting down as part of instance
  balancing or scale-down activity.

  unique to a game session.

  </li> <li> **gameSessionProperties** -- Custom data defined in a game
  session's `GameProperty` parameter. `GameProperty` values are stored as
  key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string
  to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions

  the following: `gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl"`. All custom data
  values are searched as strings.

  </li> <li> **maximumSessions** -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed
  for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session

  </li> <li> **creationTimeMillis** -- Value indicating when a game session
  was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.

  </li> <li> **playerSessionCount** -- Number of players currently connected
  to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session

  to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can
  join.

  </li> </ul> <note> Returned values for `playerSessionCount` and

  Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see
  `CreateGameSessionQueue`). When processing a placement request, Amazon
  GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations,
  scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.

  A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a
  new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player
  session for each player included in the request.

  When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in
  the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's
  destinations are listed in preference order.

  Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also
  provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data
  indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a
  fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list
  of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If
  latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates
  each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game
  play across all players.

  To place a new game session request, specify the following:

  <ul> <li> The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings

  </li> <li> A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID
  to track the status of the placement request

  </li> <li> (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each
  player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is
  optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each
  player)

  </li> <li> Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play
  for the players)

  </li> </ul> If successful, a new game session placement is created.

  To track the status of a placement request, call
  `DescribeGameSessionPlacement` and check the request's status. If the
  status is `FULFILLED`, a new game session has been created and a game
  session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out,
  you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

  Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This
  operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer
  than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they drop
  out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original
  match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a
  consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match
  anytime after a game session has been created.

  To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game
  session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that
  describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match
  backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The
  ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed. Track the
  status of the ticket to respond as needed.

  The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the
  initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups
  tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill
  ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker
  creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match are
  updated with the game session's connection information, and the
  `GameSession` object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new

  Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on
  custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players.
  Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team
  configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also
  specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game
  session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a
  single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch
  finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules,
  and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a
  `MatchmakingConfiguration`.

  To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking
  configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include
  a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If
  successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to `QUEUED`.

  Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game
  session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket
  status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple
  Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking
  configuration.

  **Processing a matchmaking request** -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking
  request as follows:

  <ol> <li> Your client code submits a `StartMatchmaking` request for one or
  more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.

  </li> <li> FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an
  acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the
  proposed match are advanced to the next status.

  </li> <li> If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking
  configuration), the tickets move into status `REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`. This
  status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in
  every ticket involved in the match, and then call `AcceptMatch` for each
  player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a
  specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see `AcceptMatch` for
  more details).

  </li> <li> Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets
  move into status `PLACING`. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game
  session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration)
  and creates the game session based on the match data.

  </li> <li> When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets
  move into `COMPLETED` status. Connection information (including game
  session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets.
  Matched players can use the connection information to join the game.

  Updates capacity settings for a fleet. Use this operation to specify the
  number of EC2 instances (hosts) that you want this fleet to contain. Before
  calling this operation, you may want to call `DescribeEC2InstanceLimits` to
  get the maximum capacity based on the fleet's EC2 instance type.

  Specify minimum and maximum number of instances. Amazon GameLift will not
  change fleet capacity to values fall outside of this range. This is
  particularly important when using auto-scaling (see `PutScalingPolicy`) to
  allow capacity to adjust based on player demand while imposing limits on
  automatic adjustments.

  To update fleet capacity, specify the fleet ID and the number of instances
  you want the fleet to host. If successful, Amazon GameLift starts or
  terminates instances so that the fleet's active instance count matches the
  desired instance count. You can view a fleet's current capacity information
  by calling `DescribeFleetCapacity`. If the desired instance count is higher
  than the instance type's limit, the "Limit Exceeded" exception occurs.

  **This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game
  server groups.**

  Updates information about a registered game server to help GameLift FleetIQ
  to track game server availability. This operation is called by a game
  server process that is running on an instance in a game server group.

  Use this operation to update the following types of game server
  information. You can make all three types of updates in the same request:

  <ul> <li> To update the game server's utilization status, identify the game
  server and game server group and specify the current utilization status.
  Use this status to identify when game servers are currently hosting games
  and when they are available to be claimed.

  </li> <li> To report health status, identify the game server and game
  server group and set health check to `HEALTHY`. If a game server does not
  report health status for a certain length of time, the game server is no
  longer considered healthy. As a result, it will be eventually deregistered
  from the game server group to avoid affecting utilization metrics. The best
  practice is to report health every 60 seconds.

  </li> <li> To change game server metadata, provide updated game server
  data.

  </li> </ul> Once a game server is successfully updated, the relevant
  statuses and timestamps are updated.
