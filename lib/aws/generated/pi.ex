  Amazon RDS Performance Insights

  Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different
  dimensions of database load based on data captured from a running DB instance.

  The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types,
  parameters and errors.

  When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API
  provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch
  provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended
  monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB
  load.

  DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides
  the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time
  dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range.
  Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions,
  measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
