defmodule AWS.Pricing do
  @moduledoc """
  Amazon Web Services Price List API is a centralized and convenient way to
  programmatically query Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing
  information.

  The Amazon Web Services Price List uses standardized product attributes such as
  `Location`, `Storage Class`, and `Operating System`, and provides prices at the
  SKU level. You can use the Amazon Web Services Price List to build cost control
  and scenario planning tools, reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for
  budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that compare your internal
  workloads with Amazon Web Services.

  Use `GetServices` without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all
  AWS services, then `GetServices` with a service code to retrieve the attribute
  names for that service. After you have the service code and attribute names, you
  can use `GetAttributeValues` to see what values are available for an attribute.
  With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use `GetProducts`
  to find specific products that you're interested in, such as an `AmazonEC2`
  instance, with a `Provisioned IOPS` `volumeType`.

  Service Endpoint

  Amazon Web Services Price List service API provides the following two endpoints:
