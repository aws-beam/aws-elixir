  This is the *AWS CodeCommit API Reference*.

  This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data types for AWS
  CodeCommit API along with usage examples.

  You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects:

  Repositories, by calling the following:

  conflicts between the base, source, and destination versions of a file in a
  potential merge.

  conflicts between the source and destination branch in a pull request.

  template. It does not remove approval rules on pull requests already created
  with the template.

  following:

    * `ListTagsForResource`, which gets information about AWS tags for a
  specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeCommit.

    * `TagResource`, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS
  CodeCommit.

  configured for a repository.
