  Generates predictions for a group of observations.

  The observations to process exist in one or more data files referenced by a
  `DataSource`. This operation creates a new `BatchPrediction`, and uses an
  `MLModel` and the data files referenced by the `DataSource` as information
  sources.

  `CreateBatchPrediction` is an asynchronous operation. In response to
  `CreateBatchPrediction`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns
  and sets the `BatchPrediction` status to `PENDING`. After the `BatchPrediction`
  completes, Amazon ML sets the status to `COMPLETED`.

  You can poll for status updates by using the `GetBatchPrediction` operation and
  checking the `Status` parameter of the result. After the `COMPLETED` status
  appears, the results are available in the location specified by the `OutputUri`

  `CreateDataSourceFromRDS` is an asynchronous operation. In response to

  Creates a `DataSource` from a database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster.

  A `DataSource` references data that can be used to perform either
  `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

  `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift` is an asynchronous operation. In response to
  `CreateDataSourceFromRedshift`, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately
  returns and sets the `DataSource` status to `PENDING`. After the `DataSource` is
  created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the `Status` parameter to `COMPLETED`.
  `DataSource` in `COMPLETED` or `PENDING` states can be used to perform only
  `CreateMLModel`, `CreateEvaluation`, or `CreateBatchPrediction` operations.

  If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the `Status` parameter to
  `FAILED` and includes an error message in the `Message` attribute of the
  `GetDataSource` operation response.

  The observations should be contained in the database hosted on an Amazon
  Redshift cluster and should be specified by a `SelectSqlQuery` query. Amazon ML
  executes an `Unload` command in Amazon Redshift to transfer the result set of
  the `SelectSqlQuery` query to `S3StagingLocation`.

  After the `DataSource` has been created, it's ready for use in evaluations and
  batch predictions. If you plan to use the `DataSource` to train an `MLModel`,
  the `DataSource` also requires a recipe. A recipe describes how each input
  variable will be used in training an `MLModel`. Will the variable be included or
  excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it
  be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word
  combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions.

  You can't change an existing datasource, but you can copy and modify the
  settings from an existing Amazon Redshift datasource to create a new datasource.
  To do so, call `GetDataSource` for an existing datasource and copy the values to
  a `CreateDataSource` call. Change the settings that you want to change and make
  sure that all required fields have the appropriate values.

  the data items by name and type. The same schema must be used for all of the

  predicted result for each observation to the actual outcome and provides a
  summary so that you know how effective the `MLModel` functions on the test data.
  Evaluation generates a relevant performance metric, such as BinaryAUC,
  RegressionRMSE or MulticlassAvgFScore based on the corresponding `MLModelType`:
  `BINARY`, `REGRESSION` or `MULTICLASS`.
