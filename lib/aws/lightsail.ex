defmodule AWS.Lightsail do

  Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers
  who just need virtual private servers. Lightsail includes everything you
  need to launch your project quickly - a virtual machine, a managed
  database, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP
  - for a low, predictable price. You manage those Lightsail servers through
  the Lightsail console or by using the API or command-line interface (CLI).

  For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the [Lightsail
  Dev Guide](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/all).

  To use the Lightsail API or the CLI, you will need to use AWS Identity and
  Access Management (IAM) to generate access keys. For details about how to
  set this up, see the [Lightsail Dev
  Guide](http://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/how-to/article/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli).

  Creates a snapshot of a block storage disk. You can use snapshots for
  backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a
  Lightsail instance.

  You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however,
  snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time
  the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been
  cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any
  file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot
  should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to
  the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance,
  issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure
  a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while
  the snapshot status is pending.

  You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's
  system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from
  the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system
  volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a
  system volume, just define the `instance name` parameter when issuing the
  snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume
  will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block
  storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to
  access the data on the disk.
