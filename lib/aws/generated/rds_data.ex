  Amazon RDS Data Service

  Amazon RDS provides an HTTP endpoint to run SQL statements on an Amazon Aurora
  Serverless DB cluster.

  To run these statements, you work with the Data Service API.

  For more information about the Data Service API, see [Using the Data API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/data-api.html)
  in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

  Runs a batch SQL statement over an array of data.

  You can run bulk update and insert operations for multiple records using a DML
  statement with different parameter sets. Bulk operations can provide a
  significant performance improvement over individual insert and update
  operations.

  If a call isn't part of a transaction because it doesn't include the
  `transactionID` parameter, changes that result from the call are committed
  automatically.

  There isn't a fixed upper limit on the number of parameter sets. However, the
  maximum size of the HTTP request submitted through the Data API is 4 MiB. If the
  request exceeds this limit, the Data API returns an error and doesn't process
  the request. This 4-MiB limit includes the size of the HTTP headers and the JSON
  notation in the request. Thus, the number of parameter sets that you can include
  depends on a combination of factors, such as the size of the SQL statement and
  the size of each parameter set.

  The response size limit is 1 MiB. If the call returns more than 1 MiB of
  response data, the call is terminated.
