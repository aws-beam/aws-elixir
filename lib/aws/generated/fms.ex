    * An WAF Classic policy (type WAF), which defines a rule group.

  filter network traffic in specified Amazon VPCs.

    * A DNS Firewall policy, which provides Route 53 Resolver DNS
  Firewall rules to filter DNS queries for specified VPCs.

  Each policy is specific to one of the types. If you want to enforce more than
  one policy type across accounts, create multiple policies. You can create
  multiple policies for each type.
