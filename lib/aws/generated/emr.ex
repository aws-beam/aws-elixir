  AddJobFlowSteps adds new steps to a running cluster. A maximum of 256 steps
  are allowed in each job flow.

  If your cluster is long-running (such as a Hive data warehouse) or complex,
  you may require more than 256 steps to process your data. You can bypass
  the 256-step limitation in various ways, including using SSH to connect to
  the master node and submitting queries directly to the software running on
  the master node, such as Hive and Hadoop. For more information on how to do
  this, see [Add More than 256 Steps to a
  Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/AddMoreThan256Steps.html)
  in the *Amazon EMR Management Guide*.

  A step specifies the location of a JAR file stored either on the master
  node of the cluster or in Amazon S3. Each step is performed by the main
  function of the main class of the JAR file. The main class can be specified
  either in the manifest of the JAR or by using the MainFunction parameter of
  the step.

  Amazon EMR executes each step in the order listed. For a step to be
  considered complete, the main function must exit with a zero exit code and
  all Hadoop jobs started while the step was running must have completed and
  run successfully.

  You can only add steps to a cluster that is in one of the following states:
  STARTING, BOOTSTRAPPING, RUNNING, or WAITING.

  `TRUE`, the cluster transitions to the WAITING state rather than shutting
  down after the steps have completed.

  it from being terminated by API call, user intervention, or in the event of
  a job flow error.

  SetTerminationProtection locks a cluster (job flow) so the EC2 instances in
  the cluster cannot be terminated by user intervention, an API call, or in

  `SetTerminationProtection` is used to prevent accidental termination of a
  cluster and to ensure that in the event of an error, the instances persist
  so that you can recover any data stored in their ephemeral instance
  storage.

  To terminate a cluster that has been locked by setting
  `SetTerminationProtection` to `true`, you must first unlock the job flow by
  a subsequent call to `SetTerminationProtection` in which you set the value
