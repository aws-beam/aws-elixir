  AWS Elastic Beanstalk

  AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy for you to create, deploy, and manage
  scalable, fault-tolerant applications running on the Amazon Web Services cloud.

  For more information about this product, go to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) details page. The location
  of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk WSDL is
  [https://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl](https://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl). To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
  Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to access the
  API, go to [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
