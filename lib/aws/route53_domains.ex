  This operation registers a domain. Domains are registered either by Amazon
  Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or by our registrar associate,
  Gandi (for all other domains). For some top-level domains (TLDs), this
  operation requires extra parameters.

  When you register a domain, Amazon Route 53 does the following:

  <ul> <li> Creates a Amazon Route 53 hosted zone that has the same name as
  the domain. Amazon Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone
  and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these
  name servers.

  </li> <li> Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew
  automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so
  you can choose whether to renew the registration.

  </li> <li> Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return
  contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org
  domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). If you
  don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS queries return the information that
  you entered for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts.

  </li> <li> If registration is successful, returns an operation ID that you
  can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request
  is not completed successfully, the domain registrant is notified by email.

  </li> <li> Charges your AWS account an amount based on the top-level
  domain. For more information, see [Amazon Route 53
  Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/).

  We recommend that you renew your domain several weeks before the expiration

  haven't renewed far enough in advance. For more information about renewing
  domain registration, see [Renewing Registration for a

  If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the
  domain, we highly recommend that you consider transferring your DNS service
  to Amazon Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer
  your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you
  purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the
  previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end
  your DNS service at any time.

  <important> If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service
  provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another
  provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the
  domain might become unavailable.
