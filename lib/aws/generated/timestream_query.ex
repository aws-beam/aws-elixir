  DescribeEndpoints returns a list of available endpoints to make Timestream API

  Because the Timestream SDKs are designed to transparently work with the

  endpoints, *it is not recommended that you use this API unless*:

  ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/VPCEndpoints)

    * Your application uses a programming language that does not yet
  have SDK support

    * You require better control over the client-side implementation

  For detailed information on how and when to use and implement DescribeEndpoints,
  see [The Endpoint Discovery Pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/Using.API.html#Using-API.endpoint-discovery).

  `Query` is a synchronous operation that enables you to run a query against your
  Amazon Timestream data.

  `Query` will time out after 60 seconds. You must update the default timeout in
  the SDK to support a timeout of 60 seconds. See the [code sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/code-samples.run-query.html)
  for details.

  Your query request will fail in the following cases:

    * If you submit a `Query` request with the same client token outside
  of the 5-minute idempotency window.

    * If you submit a `Query` request with the same client token, but
  change other parameters, within the 5-minute idempotency window.

    * If the size of the row (including the query metadata) exceeds 1
  MB, then the query will fail with the following error message:

  `Query aborted as max page response size has been exceeded by the output result
  row`

    * If the IAM principal of the query initiator and the result reader
  are not the same and/or the query initiator and the result reader do not have
  the same query string in the query requests, the query will fail with an
  `Invalid pagination token` error.
