  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities

  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped
  temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments.

  It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity
  over the lifetime of an application.

  Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with
  one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with
  Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support
  unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for
  each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by AWS Security Token
  Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.

  For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer
  Guide see [Authentication Flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html).

  For more information see [Amazon Cognito Federated Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).

  A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in

  Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a
  general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions
  of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production, you might
  assign an `Environment` tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key
  might be `Test` for one identity pool and `Production` for the other.

  Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags
  so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can
  track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM policy, you can
  constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific tags or tag values.
