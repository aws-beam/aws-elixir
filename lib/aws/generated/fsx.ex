  Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system.

  Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you
  to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file
  system.

  For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file
  systems with the following configuration:

    * a Persistent deployment type

    * is *not* linked to a data respository.

  For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see
  [Working with FSx for Lustre backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html).

  For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see
  [Working with FSx for Windows backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html).

  If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters
  match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a
  backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match,
  this operation returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a backup with the
  specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateBackup` does the following:

    * Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an
  initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.

    * Returns the description of the backup.

  By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateBackup` operation
  without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when
  an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was
  created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a
  backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are
  the same.

  The `CreateBackup` operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still
  `CREATING`. You can check the backup creation status by calling the
  `DescribeBackups` operation, which returns the backup state along with other
  information.

  Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task.

  You use data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx
  file system and its linked data repository. An example of a data repository task
  is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files,
  directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to its
  linked data repository. A `CreateDataRepositoryTask` operation will fail if a
  data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. To learn more about data
  repository tasks, see [Using Data Repository Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-repository-tasks.html).

  `CreateFileSystem` does the following:

  This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx
  uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation
