defmodule AWS.SecurityHub do
  @moduledoc """
  Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of
  your Amazon Web Services environment and resources.

  It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on
  controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data
  from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products
  and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the
  highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see
  the [ *Security HubUser Guide*
  ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html).

  When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only
  in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific
  Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration
  or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that
  Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for
  each Region to apply the change to.

  For example, if your Region is set to `us-west-2`, when you use `CreateMembers`
  to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account
  with the administrator account is created only in the `us-west-2` Region.
  Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the
  invitation was sent from.

  The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.

    * `BatchEnableStandards` - `RateLimit` of 1 request per second,
  `BurstLimit` of 1 request per second.

    * `GetFindings` - `RateLimit` of 3 requests per second. `BurstLimit`
  of 6 requests per second.

    * `BatchImportFindings` - `RateLimit` of 10 requests per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 30 requests per second.

    * `BatchUpdateFindings` - `RateLimit` of 10 requests per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 30 requests per second.

    * `UpdateStandardsControl` - `RateLimit` of 1 request per second,
  `BurstLimit` of 5 requests per second.

    * All other operations - `RateLimit` of 10 requests per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 30 requests per second.

  members.

  For accounts that are managed using Organizations, `CreateMembers` is only used
  in the following cases:

    * Security Hub is not configured to automatically add new
  organization accounts.

    * The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.

  This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To
  enable Security Hub, you can use the `EnableSecurityHub` operation.

  association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the
  invitation, you use the `InviteMembers` operation. If the account owner accepts
  the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.

  Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They
  automatically become a member account in Security Hub.

  then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that
  Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management
  account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the
  administrator account enables it as a member account.

  Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not
  change their enabled standards or controls.
