  Elastic Load Balancing

  A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances.
  This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load
  balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures
  that it routes traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load
  balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners,
  which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from
  clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for connections
  from the load balancer to the instances.

  Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application
  Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can
  select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more
  information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/).

  This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load
  Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and
  Network Load Balancers.

  To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using
  `CreateLoadBalancer`. Register your instances with the load balancer using
  `RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer`.

  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are *idempotent*, which means that
  they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds
  with a 200 OK response code.

  Adds the specified tags to the specified load balancer. Each load balancer
  can have a maximum of 10 tags.

  Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. If a tag with the same
  key is already associated with the load balancer, `AddTags` updates its
  value.

  Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/add-remove-tags.html)

  Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes that follow
  that of an application-generated cookie. This policy can be associated only

  This policy is similar to the policy created by
  `CreateLBCookieStickinessPolicy`, except that the lifetime of the special
  Elastic Load Balancing cookie, `AWSELB`, follows the lifetime of the
  application-generated cookie specified in the policy configuration. The
  load balancer only inserts a new stickiness cookie when the application
  response includes a new application cookie.

  If the application cookie is explicitly removed or expires, the session
  stops being sticky until a new application cookie is issued.

  Stickiness](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-sticky-sessions.html#enable-sticky-sessions-application)

  Generates a stickiness policy with sticky session lifetimes controlled by
  the lifetime of the browser (user-agent) or a specified expiration period.
  This policy can be associated only with HTTP/HTTPS listeners.

  When a load balancer implements this policy, the load balancer uses a
  special cookie to track the instance for each request. When the load
  balancer receives a request, it first checks to see if this cookie is
  present in the request. If so, the load balancer sends the request to the
  application server specified in the cookie. If not, the load balancer sends
  the request to a server that is chosen based on the existing load-balancing
  algorithm.

  A cookie is inserted into the response for binding subsequent requests from
  the same user to that server. The validity of the cookie is based on the
  cookie expiration time, which is specified in the policy configuration.

  You can add listeners, security groups, subnets, and tags when you create

  To describe your current load balancers, see `DescribeLoadBalancers`. When

  Adds the specified instances to the specified load balancer.

  The instance must be a running instance in the same network as the load
  balancer (EC2-Classic or the same VPC). If you have EC2-Classic instances
  and a load balancer in a VPC with ClassicLink enabled, you can link the
  EC2-Classic instances to that VPC and then register the linked EC2-Classic
  instances with the load balancer in the VPC.

  been registered. Instance registration takes a little time to complete. To
