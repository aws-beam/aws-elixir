  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is designed to automatically launch or terminate EC2
  instances based on user-defined scaling policies, scheduled actions, and health
  checks.

  Use this service with AWS Auto Scaling, Amazon CloudWatch, and Elastic Load
  Balancing.

  For more information, including information about granting IAM users required
  permissions for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling actions, see the [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html).

  When you attach instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling increases the desired
  capacity of the group by the number of instances being attached. If the number
  of instances being attached plus the desired capacity of the group exceeds the
  maximum size of the group, the operation fails.

  If there is a Classic Load Balancer attached to your Auto Scaling group, the
  instances are also registered with the load balancer. If there are target groups
  attached to your Auto Scaling group, the instances are also registered with the
  target groups.

  Starts a new instance refresh operation, which triggers a rolling replacement of
  all previously launched instances in the Auto Scaling group with a new group of
  instances.

  If successful, this call creates a new instance refresh request with a unique ID
  that you can use to track its progress. To query its status, call the
  `DescribeInstanceRefreshes` API. To describe the instance refreshes that have
  already run, call the `DescribeInstanceRefreshes` API. To cancel an instance
  refresh operation in progress, use the `CancelInstanceRefresh` API.

  Suspends the specified automatic scaling processes, or all processes, for the
  specified Auto Scaling group.

  If you suspend either the `Launch` or `Terminate` process types, it can prevent
  other process types from functioning properly. For more information, see
  [Suspending and Resuming Scaling Processes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html)
  in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

  To resume processes that have been suspended, call the `ResumeProcesses` API.

  Terminates the specified instance and optionally adjusts the desired group size.

  This call simply makes a termination request. The instance is not terminated
  immediately. When an instance is terminated, the instance status changes to
  `terminated`. You can't connect to or start an instance after you've terminated
  it.

  If you do not specify the option to decrement the desired capacity, Amazon EC2
  Auto Scaling launches instances to replace the ones that are terminated.

  By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling balances instances across all Availability
  Zones. If you decrement the desired capacity, your Auto Scaling group can become
  unbalanced between Availability Zones. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tries to
  rebalance the group, and rebalancing might terminate instances in other zones.
  For more information, see [Rebalancing Activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/auto-scaling-benefits.html#AutoScalingBehavior.InstanceUsage)
  in the *Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide*.

  Updates the configuration for the specified Auto Scaling group.

  To update an Auto Scaling group, specify the name of the group and the parameter
  that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed
  by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities
  after this call returns.

  If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling
  group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances
  continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with.
  When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch
  configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new
  purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group
  currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot
  capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated
  and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto
  Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating
  your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your
  application.

  Note the following about changing `DesiredCapacity`, `MaxSize`, or `MinSize`:

    * If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new
  `DesiredCapacity` value that is lower than the current size of the group, the
  Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to
  terminate.

    * If you specify a new value for `MinSize` without specifying a
  value for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MinSize` is larger than the current
  size of the group, this sets the group's `DesiredCapacity` to the new `MinSize`
  value.

    * If you specify a new value for `MaxSize` without specifying a
  value for `DesiredCapacity`, and the new `MaxSize` is smaller than the current
  size of the group, this sets the group's `DesiredCapacity` to the new `MaxSize`
  value.

  To see which parameters have been set, call the `DescribeAutoScalingGroups` API.
  To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the
  `DescribePolicies` API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them
  by calling the `PutScalingPolicy` API.
