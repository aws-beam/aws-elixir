  Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
  resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events
  into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in
  the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules
  to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure
  rules to:

  <ul> <li> Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries
  when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running
  state

  </li> <li> Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon
  Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or
  availability risks

  </li> <li> Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an
  Amazon EBS volume

  Running `PutPermission` permits the specified AWS account or AWS

  Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default or
  based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using `DisableRule`.

  A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated
  by AWS services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by
  SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus.
  If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their
  events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have
  created. For more information, see `CreateEventBus`.

  If you're updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you
  specify in this `PutRule` command. If you omit arguments in `PutRule`, the
  old values for those arguments aren't kept. Instead, they're replaced with
  null values.

  When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately
  start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for
  changes to take effect.

  A rule must contain at least an `EventPattern` or `ScheduleExpression`.
  Rules with `EventPatterns` are triggered when a matching event is observed.
  Rules with `ScheduleExpressions` self-trigger based on the given schedule.
  A rule can have both an `EventPattern` and a `ScheduleExpression`, in which
  case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.

  When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more
  tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources.
  You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user
  permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use
  the `PutRule` operation and assign tags, you must have both the
  `events:PutRule` and `events:TagResource` permissions.

  If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the `PutRule`
  operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use
  `TagResource` and `UntagResource`.

  Most services in AWS treat `:` or `/` as the same character in Amazon
  Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event
  patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating
  event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event that you want
  to match.

  In EventBridge, you could create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a
  rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have
  changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired
  state. If you don't write the rule carefully, the subsequent change to the
  ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.

  To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions don't refire
  the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to
  be in a bad state, instead of after any change.

  An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We
  recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your
  specified limit. For more information, see [Managing Your Costs with
  Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html).

  @doc """
  Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if
  they're already associated with the rule.

  Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.

  You can configure the following as targets in EventBridge:

  <ul> <li> EC2 instances

  </li> <li> SSM Run Command

  </li> <li> SSM Automation

  </li> <li> AWS Lambda functions

  </li> <li> Data streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams

  </li> <li> Data delivery streams in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

  </li> <li> Amazon ECS tasks

  </li> <li> AWS Step Functions state machines

  </li> <li> AWS Batch jobs

  </li> <li> AWS CodeBuild projects

  </li> <li> Pipelines in AWS CodePipeline

  </li> <li> Amazon Inspector assessment templates

  </li> <li> Amazon SNS topics

  </li> <li> Amazon SQS queues, including FIFO queues

  </li> <li> The default event bus of another AWS account

  </li> </ul> Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only on the
  AWS Management Console. The built-in targets are `EC2 CreateSnapshot API
  call`, `EC2 RebootInstances API call`, `EC2 StopInstances API call`, and
  `EC2 TerminateInstances API call`.

  For some target types, `PutTargets` provides target-specific parameters. If
  the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard
  the event goes to by using the `KinesisParameters` argument. To invoke a
  command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the
  `RunCommandParameters` field.

  To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon
  EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon
  SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2
  instances, Kinesis data streams, and AWS Step Functions state machines,
  EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the `RoleARN` argument
  in `PutTargets`. For more information, see [Authentication and Access
  Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html)
  in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

  If another AWS account is in the same Region and has granted you permission
  (using `PutPermission`), you can send events to that account. Set that
  account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the
  matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as
  the `Arn` value when you run `PutTargets`. If your account sends events to
  another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event
  sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving
  the event isn't charged. For more information, see [Amazon EventBridge
  Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/).

  If you're setting an event bus in another account as the target and that
  account granted permission to your account through an organization instead
  of directly by the account ID, you must specify a `RoleArn` with proper
  permissions in the `Target` structure. For more information, see [Sending
  and Receiving Events Between AWS
  Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eventbridge-cross-account-event-delivery.html)
  in the *Amazon EventBridge User Guide*.

  For more information about enabling cross-account events, see
  `PutPermission`.

  `Input`, `InputPath`, and `InputTransformer` are mutually exclusive and
  optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched
  event:

  <ul> <li> If none of the following arguments are specified for a target,
  the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target
  is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from
  the event is passed to the target).

  </li> <li> If `Input` is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the
  matched event is overridden with this constant.

  </li> <li> If `InputPath` is specified in the form of JSONPath (for
  example, `$.detail`), only the part of the event specified in the path is
  passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is
  passed).

  </li> <li> If `InputTransformer` is specified, one or more specified
  JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template
  that you specify as the input to the target.

  </li> </ul> When you specify `InputPath` or `InputTransformer`, you must
  use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.

  When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after,
  new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short
  period of time for changes to take effect.

  This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same
  time. If that happens, `FailedEntryCount` is nonzero in the response, and
  each entry in `FailedEntries` provides the ID of the failed target and the
  error code.
