  Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference.

  This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Amazon
  AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors.

  Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to
  securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applications like
  Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and
  Amazon Redshift.

  Use the following links to get started on the Amazon AppFlow API:

    *
  [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/API_Operations.html): An alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow API operations.

    * [Data
  types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/API_Types.html): An
  alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow data types.

    * [Common parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/CommonParameters.html):
  Parameters that all Query operations can use.

    * [Common errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/CommonErrors.html):
  Client and server errors that all operations can return.

  If you're new to Amazon AppFlow, we recommend that you review the [Amazon AppFlow User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/what-is-appflow.html).

  Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and
  include applicable OAuth attributes (such as `auth-code` and `redirecturi`) with
  the connector-specific `ConnectorProfileProperties` when creating a new
  connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce
  users can refer to the [ *Authorize Apps with OAuth*
  ](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm)
  documentation.
