  Resource Groups Tagging API

  This guide describes the API operations for the resource groups tagging.

  A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag consists of a
  key and a value, both of which you define. For example, if you have two
  Amazon EC2 instances, you might assign both a tag key of "Stack." But the
  value of "Stack" might be "Testing" for one and "Production" for the other.

  <important> Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other
  confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to provide you
  with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to be used
  for private or sensitive data.

  </important> Tagging can help you organize your resources and enables you
  to simplify resource management, access management and cost allocation.

  You can use the resource groups tagging API operations to complete the
  following tasks:

  <ul> <li> Tag and untag supported resources located in the specified Region
  for the AWS account.

  </li> <li> Use tag-based filters to search for resources located in the
  specified Region for the AWS account.

  </li> <li> List all existing tag keys in the specified Region for the AWS
  account.

  </li> <li> List all existing values for the specified key in the specified
  Region for the AWS account.

  </li> </ul> To use resource groups tagging API operations, you must add the
  following permissions to your IAM policy:

  <ul> <li> `tag:GetResources`

  </li> <li> `tag:TagResources`

  </li> <li> `tag:UntagResources`

  </li> <li> `tag:GetTagKeys`

  </li> <li> `tag:GetTagValues`

  </li> </ul> You'll also need permissions to access the resources of
  individual services so that you can tag and untag those resources.

  For more information on IAM policies, see [Managing IAM
  Policies](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html)
  in the *IAM User Guide*.
