  Elastic Load Balancing

  A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2
  instances.

  This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load
  balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it
  routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to
  accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are
  configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the
  load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for
  connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check
  settings to be used when checking the health status of the targets.

  Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers:
  Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and
  Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load balancer types:

    * Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer
  (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.

    * Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4)
  and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.

    * Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).

  For more information, see the [Elastic Load Balancing User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/).

  All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they
  complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds.
