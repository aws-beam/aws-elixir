  @moduledoc """
  AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of
  files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL
  (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and
  out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

  AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer
  Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS
  routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners,
  or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS
  services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting
  started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy
  and set up.
