  ## Overview

  This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference.

  This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS
  CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured
  through the API. For more information, see the [AWS CodePipeline User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

  You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions,
  and transitions.

  *Pipelines* are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely
  named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.

  You can work with pipelines by calling:

    * `CreatePipeline`, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.

    * `DeletePipeline`, which deletes the specified pipeline.

    * `GetPipeline`, which returns information about the pipeline
  structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN).

    * `GetPipelineExecution`, which returns information about a specific
  execution of a pipeline.

    * `GetPipelineState`, which returns information about the current
  state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.

    * `ListActionExecutions`, which returns action-level details for
  past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details,
  including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during
  the execution, and input and output artifact location details.

    * `ListPipelines`, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines
  associated with your account.

    * `ListPipelineExecutions`, which gets a summary of the most recent
  executions for a pipeline.

    * `StartPipelineExecution`, which runs the most recent revision of
  an artifact through the pipeline.

    * `StopPipelineExecution`, which stops the specified pipeline
  execution from continuing through the pipeline.

    * `UpdatePipeline`, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes
  to the structure of the pipeline.

  Pipelines include *stages*. Each stage contains one or more actions that must
  complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If
  a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either
  a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes
  action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call
  `GetPipelineState`, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the
  status of stages in the pipeline, or `GetPipeline`, which returns the entire
  structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more
  information about the structure of stages and actions, see [AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure
  Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html).

  Pipeline stages include *actions* that are categorized into categories such as
  source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can
  use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as
  Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but
  you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations
  such as `CreatePipeline` and `GetPipelineState`. Valid action categories are:

    * Source

    * Build

    * Test

    * Deploy

    * Approval

    * Invoke

  Pipelines also include *transitions*, which allow the transition of artifacts
  from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage
  complete.

  You can work with transitions by calling:

    * `DisableStageTransition`, which prevents artifacts from
  transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.

    * `EnableStageTransition`, which enables transition of artifacts
  between stages in a pipeline.

  ## Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline

  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own
  integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the
  standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work
  with the following items:

  **Jobs**, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source
  action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.

  You can work with jobs by calling:

    * `AcknowledgeJob`, which confirms whether a job worker has received
  the specified job.

    * `GetJobDetails`, which returns the details of a job.

    * `PollForJobs`, which determines whether there are any jobs to act
  on.

    * `PutJobFailureResult`, which provides details of a job failure.

    * `PutJobSuccessResult`, which provides details of a job success.

  **Third party jobs**, which are instances of an action created by a partner
  action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by
  members of the AWS Partner Network.

  You can work with third party jobs by calling:

    * `AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob`, which confirms whether a job worker
  has received the specified job.

    * `GetThirdPartyJobDetails`, which requests the details of a job for
  a partner action.

    * `PollForThirdPartyJobs`, which determines whether there are any
  jobs to act on.

    * `PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult`, which provides details of a job
  failure.

    * `PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult`, which provides details of a job
  success.
