  Amazon ElastiCache

  Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and
  scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

  With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance,
  in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and
  managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster
  failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment.

  In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced
  visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and
  can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.

  Creates a Redis (cluster mode disabled) or a Redis (cluster mode enabled)
  replication group.

  This API can be used to create a standalone regional replication group or a
  secondary replication group associated with a Global datastore.

  A Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group is a collection of clusters,
  where one of the clusters is a read/write primary and the others are read-only
  replicas. Writes to the primary are asynchronously propagated to the replicas.

  A Redis cluster-mode enabled cluster is comprised of from 1 to 90 shards
  (API/CLI: node groups). Each shard has a primary node and up to 5 read-only
  replica nodes. The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15
  shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed.

  The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the
  Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to
  configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between 83 shards (one primary and 5
  replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure
  there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase. Common
  pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or
  the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information,
  see [Creating a Subnet Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SubnetGroups.Creating.html).
  For versions below 5.0.6, the limit is 250 per cluster.

  To request a limit increase, see [Amazon Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html)
  and choose the limit type **Nodes per cluster per instance type**.

  When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully
  created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read
  replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups
  (console: shards), you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for Redis' scaling. For
  more information, see [Scaling ElastiCache for Redis Clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Scaling.html)

  Represents the input of a `TestFailover` operation which test automatic failover
  on a specified node group (called shard in the console) in a replication group
  (called cluster in the console).

  This API is designed for testing the behavior of your application in case of
  ElastiCache failover. It is not designed to be an operational tool for
  initiating a failover to overcome a problem you may have with the cluster.
  Moreover, in certain conditions such as large-scale operational events, Amazon
  may block this API.

  ## Note the following

    * A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on up
  to 5 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and Amazon CLI) in any
  rolling 24-hour period.

    * If calling this operation on shards in different clusters (called
  replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made concurrently.

    * If calling this operation multiple times on different shards in
  the same Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the first node
  replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.

    * To determine whether the node replacement is complete you can
  check Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the Amazon CLI, or the
  ElastiCache API. Look for the following automatic failover related events,
  listed here in order of occurrance:

      1. Replication group message: `Test Failover API called
  for node group <node-group-id>`

      2. Cache cluster message: `Failover from primary node
  <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed`

      3. Replication group message: `Failover from primary
  node <primary-node-id> to replica node <node-id> completed`

      4. Cache cluster message: `Recovering cache nodes
  <node-id>`

      5. Cache cluster message: `Finished recovery for cache
  nodes <node-id>`
