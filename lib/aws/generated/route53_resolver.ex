defmodule AWS.Route53Resolver do
  @moduledoc """
  When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution
  within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver.

  By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain
  names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver
  performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
  names.

  You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a
  Direct Connect or VPN connection:

  ## Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver

  DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified
  VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain names for Amazon
  Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private
  hosted zone. For more information, see [How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53
  Resolver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  ## Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network

  You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
  instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected
  queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS
  queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of
  the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a
  query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses
  the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query
  to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see
  [How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network)
  in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*.

  Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you
  can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound
  queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.
