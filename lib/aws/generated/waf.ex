  Creates a `ByteMatchSet`. You then use `UpdateByteMatchSet` to identify the part
  of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as the values of the
  `User-Agent` header or the query string. For example, you can create a
  `ByteMatchSet` that matches any requests with `User-Agent` headers that contain
  the string `BadBot`. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests.

  To create and configure a `ByteMatchSet`, perform the following steps:

    1. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of a `CreateByteMatchSet` request.

    2. Submit a `CreateByteMatchSet` request.

    3. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in

  With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and

  Creates an `IPSet`, which you use to specify which web requests that you want to
  allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originate from. For
  example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or more individual IP
  addresses or one or more ranges of IP addresses and you want to block the
  requests, you can create an `IPSet` that contains those IP addresses and then
  configure AWS WAF to block the requests.

  To create and configure an `IPSet`, perform the following steps:

  **For the latest version of AWS WAF**, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the [AWS WAF Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html).
  With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and
  global use.

  Creates a `RateBasedRule`. The `RateBasedRule` contains a `RateLimit`, which
  specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP
  address in a five-minute period. The `RateBasedRule` also contains the `IPSet`
  objects, `ByteMatchSet` objects, and other predicates that identify the requests
  that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the `RateLimit`.

  If you add more than one predicate to a `RateBasedRule`, a request not only must
  exceed the `RateLimit`, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted
  or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a `RateBasedRule`:

    * An `IPSet` that matches the IP address `192.0.2.44/32`

    * A `ByteMatchSet` that matches `BadBot` in the `User-Agent` header

  Further, you specify a `RateLimit` of 1,000.

  You then add the `RateBasedRule` to a `WebACL` and specify that you want to
  block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be
  blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 *and* the `User-Agent`
  header in the request must contain the value `BadBot`. Further, requests that
  match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000
  requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is
  exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a
  five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.

  As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on
  your site. To do this, you could add the following to a `RateBasedRule`:

    * A `ByteMatchSet` with `FieldToMatch` of `URI`

    * A `PositionalConstraint` of `STARTS_WITH`

    * A `TargetString` of `login`

  Further, you specify a `RateLimit` of 1,000.

  By adding this `RateBasedRule` to a `WebACL`, you could limit requests to your
  login page without affecting the rest of your site.

  To create and configure a `RateBasedRule`, perform the following steps:

    1. Create and update the predicates that you want to include in the
  rule. For more information, see `CreateByteMatchSet`, `CreateIPSet`, and
  `CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet`.

    2. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of a `CreateRule` request.

    3. Submit a `CreateRateBasedRule` request.

    4. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of an `UpdateRule` request.

    5. Submit an `UpdateRateBasedRule` request to specify the predicates
  that you want to include in the rule.

    6. Create and update a `WebACL` that contains the `RateBasedRule`.

  Gets detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sample--that
  AWS WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that your AWS
  resource received during a time range that you choose. You can specify a sample
  size of up to 500 requests, and you can specify any time range in the previous
  three hours.

  `GetSampledRequests` returns a time range, which is usually the time range that
  you specified. However, if your resource (such as a CloudFront distribution)
  received 5,000 requests before the specified time range elapsed,
  `GetSampledRequests` returns an updated time range. This new time range
  indicates the actual period during which AWS WAF selected the requests in the
  sample.

  Associates a `LoggingConfiguration` with a specified web ACL.

  You can access information about all traffic that AWS WAF inspects using the
  following steps:

    1. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

  Create the data firehose with a PUT source and in the region that you are
  operating. However, if you are capturing logs for Amazon CloudFront, always
  create the firehose in US East (N. Virginia).

  Do not create the data firehose using a `Kinesis stream` as your source.

    2. Associate that firehose to your web ACL using a
  `PutLoggingConfiguration` request.

  When you successfully enable logging using a `PutLoggingConfiguration` request,
  AWS WAF will create a service linked role with the necessary permissions to
  write logs to the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. For more information, see

  Inserts or deletes `ByteMatchTuple` objects (filters) in a `ByteMatchSet`. For
  each `ByteMatchTuple` object, you specify the following values:

    * Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want
  to change a `ByteMatchSetUpdate` object, you delete the existing object and add
  a new one.

    * The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such
  as a query string or the value of the `User-Agent` header.

    * The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII
  characters) that you want AWS WAF to look for. For more information, including
  how you specify the values for the AWS WAF API and the AWS CLI or SDKs, see
  `TargetString` in the `ByteMatchTuple` data type.

    * Where to look, such as at the beginning or the end of a query
  string.

    * Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as
  converting it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the specified string.

  For example, you can add a `ByteMatchSetUpdate` object that matches web requests
  in which `User-Agent` headers contain the string `BadBot`. You can then
  configure AWS WAF to block those requests.

  To create and configure a `ByteMatchSet`, perform the following steps:

    1. Create a `ByteMatchSet.` For more information, see
  `CreateByteMatchSet`.

    2. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of an `UpdateByteMatchSet` request.

    3. Submit an `UpdateByteMatchSet` request to specify the part of the
  request that you want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or the URI)
  and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

    * 1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128

    * 1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128

    * 1111::0111/128

    * 1111::111/128

  You use an `IPSet` to specify which web requests you want to allow or block
  based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if
  you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses
  and you want to block the requests, you can create an `IPSet` that specifies
  those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.

  To create and configure an `IPSet`, perform the following steps:

    1. Submit a `CreateIPSet` request.

    2. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of an `UpdateIPSet` request.

    3. Submit an `UpdateIPSet` request to specify the IP addresses that
  you want AWS WAF to watch for.

  When you update an `IPSet`, you specify the IP addresses that you want to add
  and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want to change an IP
  address, you delete the existing IP address and add the new one.

  You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request.

  With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and

  Inserts or deletes `Predicate` objects in a rule and updates the `RateLimit` in
  the rule.

  Each `Predicate` object identifies a predicate, such as a `ByteMatchSet` or an
  `IPSet`, that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The
  `RateLimit` specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers
  the rule.

  If you add more than one predicate to a `RateBasedRule`, a request must match
  all the predicates and exceed the `RateLimit` to be counted or blocked. For
  example, suppose you add the following to a `RateBasedRule`:

    * An `IPSet` that matches the IP address `192.0.2.44/32`

    * A `ByteMatchSet` that matches `BadBot` in the `User-Agent` header

  Further, you specify a `RateLimit` of 1,000.

  You then add the `RateBasedRule` to a `WebACL` and specify that you want to
  block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come
  from the IP address 192.0.2.44 *and* the `User-Agent` header in the request must
  contain the value `BadBot`. Further, requests that match these two conditions
  much be received at a rate of more than 1,000 every five minutes. If the rate
  drops below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.

  As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on
  your site. To do this, you could add the following to a `RateBasedRule`:

    * A `ByteMatchSet` with `FieldToMatch` of `URI`

    * A `PositionalConstraint` of `STARTS_WITH`

    * A `TargetString` of `login`

  Further, you specify a `RateLimit` of 1,000.

  By adding this `RateBasedRule` to a `WebACL`, you could limit requests to your
  login page without affecting the rest of your site.

  Inserts or deletes `ActivatedRule` objects in a `WebACL`. Each `Rule` identifies
  web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you update a
  `WebACL`, you specify the following values:

    * A default action for the `WebACL`, either `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`. AWS
  WAF performs the default action if a request doesn't match the criteria in any
  of the `Rules` in a `WebACL`.

    * The `Rules` that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace
  one `Rule` with another, you delete the existing `Rule` and add the new one.

    * For each `Rule`, whether you want AWS WAF to allow requests, block
  requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the `Rule`.

    * The order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the `Rules` in a
  `WebACL`. If you add more than one `Rule` to a `WebACL`, AWS WAF evaluates each
  request against the `Rules` in order based on the value of `Priority`. (The
  `Rule` that has the lowest value for `Priority` is evaluated first.) When a web
  request matches all the predicates (such as `ByteMatchSets` and `IPSets`) in a
  `Rule`, AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and
  doesn't evaluate the request against the remaining `Rules` in the `WebACL`, if
  any.

  To create and configure a `WebACL`, perform the following steps:

    1. Create and update the predicates that you want to include in
  `Rules`. For more information, see `CreateByteMatchSet`, `UpdateByteMatchSet`,
  `CreateIPSet`, `UpdateIPSet`, `CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet`, and
  `UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet`.

    2. Create and update the `Rules` that you want to include in the
  `WebACL`. For more information, see `CreateRule` and `UpdateRule`.

    3. Create a `WebACL`. See `CreateWebACL`.

    4. Use `GetChangeToken` to get the change token that you provide in
  the `ChangeToken` parameter of an `UpdateWebACL` request.

    5. Submit an `UpdateWebACL` request to specify the `Rules` that you
  want to include in the `WebACL`, to specify the default action, and to associate
  the `WebACL` with a CloudFront distribution.

  The `ActivatedRule` can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your
  `ActivatedRule` , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group.

  If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an
  `UpdateWebACL` request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must
  first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re-insert it again, specifying
  the excluded rules. For details, see `ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules` .

  Be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting
  the rule type when first creating the rule, the `UpdateWebACL` request will fail
  because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the
  specified ID, which does not exist.
