  AWS Cloud Map lets you configure public DNS, private DNS, or HTTP
  namespaces that your microservice applications run in. When an instance of
  the service becomes available, you can call the AWS Cloud Map API to
  register the instance with AWS Cloud Map. For public or private DNS
  namespaces, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records and an optional
  health check. Clients that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP
  requests, for the service receive an answer that contains up to eight
  healthy records.

  specified by `ServiceId`, a record is created or updated in the hosted zone
  that is associated with the corresponding namespace.

  created based on the settings in the health check configuration.
