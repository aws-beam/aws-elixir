defmodule AWS.Budgets do
  @moduledoc """
  The AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service
  usage, service costs, and instance reservations. The API reference provides
  descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
  types for AWS Budgets.

  Budgets provide you with a way to see the following information:

  <ul> <li> How close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free
  tier limits

  </li> <li> Your usage-to-date, including how much you've used of your
  Reserved Instances (RIs)

  </li> <li> Your current estimated charges from AWS, and how much your
  predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month

  </li> <li> How much of your budget has been used

  </li> </ul> AWS updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets
  track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create
  the following types of budgets:

  <ul> <li> **Cost budgets** - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.

  </li> <li> **Usage budgets** - Plan how much you want to use one or more
  services.

  </li> <li> **RI utilization budgets** - Define a utilization threshold, and
  receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you
  see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.

  </li> <li> **RI coverage budgets** - Define a coverage threshold, and
  receive alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by
  RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance
  usage is covered by a reservation.

  </li> </ul> Service Endpoint

  The AWS Budgets API provides the following endpoint:

  <ul> <li> https://budgets.amazonaws.com

  </li> </ul> For information about costs that are associated with the AWS
  Budgets API, see [AWS Cost Management
  Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).
