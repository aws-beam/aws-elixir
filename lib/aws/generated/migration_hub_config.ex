  The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for
  working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to
  determine a home region, as well as to create and work with controls that
  describe the home region.

  <ul> <li> You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
  associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
  `HomeRegionNotSetException` error is returned.

  </li> <li> API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete)
  are permitted outside of your home region.

  </li> <li> If you call a write API outside the home region, an
  `InvalidInputException` is returned.

  </li> <li> You can call `GetHomeRegion` action to obtain the account's
  Migration Hub home region.

  </li> </ul> For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this
  AWS Migration Hub Home Region API reference.
