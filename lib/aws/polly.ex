  Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech from
  text.

  The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for synthesizing
  high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language
  (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you to get
  the best results for your application domain.

  Deletes the specified pronunciation lexicon stored in an AWS Region. A
  lexicon which has been deleted is not available for speech synthesis, nor
  is it possible to retrieve it using either the `GetLexicon` or
  `ListLexicon` APIs.

  Lexicons](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/managing-lexicons.html).

  Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting
  speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male or
  female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the voice
  name.

  When synthesizing speech ( `SynthesizeSpeech` ), you provide the voice ID
  for the voice you want from the list of voices returned by
  `DescribeVoices`.

  For example, you want your news reader application to read news in a
  specific language, but giving a user the option to choose the voice. Using
  the `DescribeVoices` operation you can provide the user with a list of
  available voices to select from.

  You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices.
  For example, if you specify `en-US`, the operation returns a list of all
  available US English voices.

  This operation requires permissions to perform the `polly:DescribeVoices`
  action.
