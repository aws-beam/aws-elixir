# AWS clients for Elixir

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-elixir/actions)

## Features

* Generated by [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) using the
  same JSON descriptions of AWS services used to build the
  [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis).
* Support for most AWS services that use `json` and `rest-json` protocols.


## Example

Listing Amazon Kinesis streams. Start a console with `iex -S mix`:

```elixir
iex> client = %AWS.Client{access_key_id: "<access-key-id>",
                     secret_access_key: "<secret-access-key>",
                     region: "us-east-1",
                     endpoint: "amazonaws.com"}

iex> {:ok, result, resp} = AWS.Kinesis.list_streams(client, %{})

iex> IO.inspect result
%{"HasMoreStreams" => false, "StreamNames" => []}
```

## Usage

* Add it as a Mix dependency in the project.

  ```elixir
  def deps do
    [{:aws, "~> 0.5.0"}]
  end
  ```

* Run `mix deps.get` to install.

## Development

Code is generated using the [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen)
library from the JSON descriptions of AWS services provided by Amazon.

## Documentation

* Run `MIX_ENV=docs mix docs`
