  Amazon Cognito Sync

  Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
  cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client
  libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these
  libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device
  is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile
  device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a
  normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset
  that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20
  datasets per user identity.

  With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible
  only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito
  Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with
  [Amazon Cognito Identity
  service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

  If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will
  probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see
  the [Developer Guide for
  Android](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html)
  and the [Developer Guide for
  iOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html).
