  Identity and Access Management

  Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling
  access to Amazon Web Services services.

  With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access
  keys, and permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and
  applications can access. For more information about IAM, see [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) and the [Identity and Access Management User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).

  Creates an IAM entity to describe an identity provider (IdP) that supports
  [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](http://openid.net/connect/).   The OIDC provider that you create with this operation can be used as a principal
  in a role's trust policy. Such a policy establishes a trust relationship between
  Amazon Web Services and the OIDC provider.

  If you are using an OIDC identity provider from Google, Facebook, or Amazon
  Cognito, you don't need to create a separate IAM identity provider. These OIDC
  identity providers are already built-in to Amazon Web Services and are available
  for your use. Instead, you can move directly to creating new roles using your
  identity provider. To learn more, see [Creating a role for web identity or
  OpenID connect
  federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html)

    * The URL of the OIDC identity provider (IdP) to trust

    * A list of client IDs (also known as audiences) that identify the
  application or applications allowed to authenticate using the OIDC provider

    * A list of thumbprints of one or more server certificates that the
  IdP uses

  You get all of this information from the OIDC IdP you want to use to access
  Amazon Web Services.

  Amazon Web Services secures communication with some OIDC identity providers
  (IdPs) through our library of trusted certificate authorities (CAs) instead of
  using a certificate thumbprint to verify your IdP server certificate. These OIDC
  IdPs include Google, and those that use an Amazon S3 bucket to host a JSON Web
  Key Set (JWKS) endpoint. In these cases, your legacy thumbprint remains in your
  configuration, but is no longer used for validation.

  The trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the IAM provider that this
  operation creates. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the
  `CreateOpenIDConnectProvider` operation to highly privileged users.

  To call this operation, you must be signed in using your Organizations
  management account credentials. You can use your long-term IAM user or root user
  credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be
  enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and
  Organizations permissions. For more information, see [Refining permissions using service last accessed

  You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying
  only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed
  by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity.

  You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying
  an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a
  list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.

  For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account
  activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the
  entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period,
  permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see [Reducing permissions using service last accessed
  data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_access-advisor.html)

  The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the
  successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web
  Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the
  SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last
  accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the

  This operation returns a `JobId`. Use this parameter in the `
  `GetOrganizationsAccessReport` ` operation to check the status of the report
  generation. To check the status of this request, use the `JobId` parameter in
  the ` `GetOrganizationsAccessReport` ` operation and test the `JobStatus`
  response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report.

  To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity
  path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity
  that you specify determines the data returned in the report.

    * **Root** – When you specify the organizations root as the entity,
  the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached
  to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in
  your organization except the management account, because the management account
  is not limited by SCPs.

    * **OU** – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the
  entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are
  attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data
  for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the management
  account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.

    * **management account** – When you specify the management account,
  the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the
  management account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes
  data for only the management account.

    * **Account** – When you specify another account as the entity, the
  resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to
  the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only
  the specified account.

  To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity
  path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you
  specify determines the data returned for each service.

    * **Root** – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the
  resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified
  SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your
  organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the management
  account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is
  not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a
  list of services with no data.

    * **OU** – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the
  resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified
  SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or
  its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside
  the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data
  excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited
  by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report
  will return a list of services with no data.

    * **management account** – When you specify the management account,
  the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the
  management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI
  or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for
  only the management account.

    * **Account** – When you specify another account entity and a policy
  ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the
  specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified
  account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by
  the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the
  account, the report will return a list of services with no data.

  Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining
  whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include
  identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM
  permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic.

  resource could access using permissions policies. For each service, the response
  includes information about the most recent access attempt.

  The `JobId` returned by `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail` must be used by the
  same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call
  `GetServiceLastAccessedDetail`.

    * `GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities` – Use this operation
  for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users
  or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Services service.

  To check the status of the `GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails` request, use the
  `JobId` parameter in the same operations and test the `JobStatus` response
  parameter.

  access the service. If the operation fails, the `GetServiceLastAccessedDetails`
  operation returns the reason that it failed.
