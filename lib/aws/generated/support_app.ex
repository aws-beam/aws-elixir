  Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack

  You can use the Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack API to manage your
  support cases in Slack for your Amazon Web Services account.

  After you configure your Slack workspace and channel with the Amazon Web
  Services Support App, you can perform the following tasks directly in your Slack
  channel:

    * Create, search, update, and resolve your support cases

    * Request service quota increases for your account

    * Invite Amazon Web Services Support agents to your channel so that
  you can chat directly about your support cases

  For more information about how to perform these actions in Slack, see the
  following documentation in the *Amazon Web Services Support User Guide*:

    * [Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/aws-support-app-for-slack.html)

    * [Joining a live chat session with Amazon Web Services Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/joining-a-live-chat-session.html)

    * [Requesting service quota increases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/service-quota-increase.html)

    * [Amazon Web Services Support App commands in Slack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/support-app-commands.html)

  You can also use the Amazon Web Services Management Console instead of the
  Amazon Web Services Support App API to manage your Slack configurations. For
  more information, see [Authorize a Slack workspace to enable the Amazon Web Services Support
  App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/authorize-slack-workspace.html).

  `    You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the
  Amazon Web Services Support App API.

     For more information about the Amazon Web Services Support App
  endpoints, see the [Amazon Web Services Support App in Slack endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/awssupport.html#awssupport_app_region)
  in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

  Creates a Slack channel configuration for your Amazon Web Services account.

     You can add up to 5 Slack workspaces for your account.

     You can add up to 20 Slack channels for your account.

  A Slack channel can have up to 100 Amazon Web Services accounts. This means that
  only 100 accounts can add the same Slack channel to the Amazon Web Services
  Support App. We recommend that you only add the accounts that you need to manage
  support cases for your organization. This can reduce the notifications about
  case updates that you receive in the Slack channel.

  We recommend that you choose a private Slack channel so that only members in
  that channel have read and write access to your support cases. Anyone in your
  Slack channel can create, update, or resolve support cases for your account.
  Users require an invitation to join private channels.
