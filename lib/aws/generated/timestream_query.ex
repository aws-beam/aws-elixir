  DescribeEndpoints returns a list of available endpoints to make Timestream
  API calls against. This API is available through both Write and Query.

  Because Timestream’s SDKs are designed to transparently work with the
  service’s architecture, including the management and mapping of the service
  endpoints, *it is not recommended that you use this API unless*:

  <ul> <li> Your application uses a programming language that does not yet
  have SDK support

  </li> <li> You require better control over the client-side implementation

  </li> </ul> For detailed information on how to use DescribeEndpoints, see
  [The Endpoint Discovery Pattern and REST
  APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/Using-API.endpoint-discovery.html).

  Query is a synchronous operation that enables you to execute a query. Query
  will timeout after 60 seconds. You must update the default timeout in the
  SDK to support a timeout of 60 seconds. The result set will be truncated to
  1MB. Service quotas apply. For more information, see Quotas in the
  Timestream Developer Guide.
