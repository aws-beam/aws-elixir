  Welcome to the *Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2 API Reference*.

  This guide provides information about Amazon Pinpoint SMS and Voice, version 2
  API resources, including supported HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas.

  Amazon Pinpoint is an Amazon Web Services service that you can use to engage
  with your recipients across multiple messaging channels. The Amazon Pinpoint SMS
  and Voice, version 2 API provides programmatic access to options that are unique
  to the SMS and voice channels and supplements the resources provided by the
  Amazon Pinpoint API.

  If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, it's also helpful to review the [ Amazon Pinpoint Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html).
  The *Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide* provides tutorials, code samples, and
  procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically
  and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other
  types of applications. The guide also provides key information, such as Amazon
  Pinpoint integration with other Amazon Web Services services, and the quotas
  that apply to use of the service.
