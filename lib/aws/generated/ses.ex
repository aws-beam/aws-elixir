  The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:

  will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are

  </li> <li> The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the

  Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.

  This operation is more flexible than the `SendEmail` API operation. When
  you use the `SendRawEmail` operation, you can specify the headers of the
  message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example,
  when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains
  both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send
  messages that include attachments.

  The `SendRawEmail` operation has the following requirements:

  <ul> <li> You can only send email from [verified email addresses or
  domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html).
  If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation
  results in an "Email address not verified" error.

  </li> <li> If your account is still in the [Amazon SES
  sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html),
  you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to
  addresses that are associated with the [Amazon SES mailbox
  simulator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html).

  </li> <li> The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.

  </li> <li> Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A
  recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.

  </li> <li> If you send a single message to more than one recipient address,
  and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's
  not in the format *UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), Amazon SES
  rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.

  </li> <li> Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the
  To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than
  50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into
  groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each
  group.

  </li> <li> Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding
  for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents
  of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit
  content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you
  encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see [MIME
  Encoding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-raw.html#send-email-mime-encoding)
  in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide*.

  </li> </ul> Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when
  using the `SendRawEmail` operation:

  <ul> <li> Although you can customize the message headers when using the
  `SendRawEmail` operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own
  `Message-ID` and `Date` headers; if you passed these headers when creating
  the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES
  provides.

  </li> <li> If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of
  another user, `SendRawEmail` enables you to specify the cross-account
  identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of
  two ways: you can pass optional parameters `SourceArn`, `FromArn`, and/or
  `ReturnPathArn` to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in
  the header of your raw email:

  <ul> <li> `X-SES-SOURCE-ARN`

  </li> <li> `X-SES-FROM-ARN`

  </li> <li> `X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN`

  </li> </ul> <important> Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM
  signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.

  </important> If you only specify the `SourceIdentityArn` parameter, Amazon
  SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you
  specified.

  For more information about sending authorization, see the [Using Sending
  Authorization with Amazon
  SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/sending-authorization.html)
  in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

  </li> <li> For every message that you send, the total number of recipients
  (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
  against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your
  *sending quota*). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES,

  Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it
  for sending.

  In order to send email using the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation, your call
  to the API must meet the following requirements:

  <ul> <li> The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create
  email templates using the `CreateTemplate` operation.

  </li> <li> The message must be sent from a verified email address or
  domain.

  </li> <li> If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only
  send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated
  with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see [Verifying
  Email Addresses and
  Domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html)
  in the *Amazon SES Developer Guide.*

  </li> <li> The maximum message size is 10 MB.

  </li> <li> Calls to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation may only include one
  `Destination` parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who will
  receive the same version of the email. The `Destination` parameter can
  include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.

  </li> <li> The `Destination` parameter must include at least one recipient
  email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address,
  or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is
  not in the format *UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain*), the entire
  message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients
  that are valid.

  </li> </ul> <important> If your call to the `SendTemplatedEmail` operation
  includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns
  a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the
  template contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because
  it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message
  stating that it was unable to send the email.

  For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send
  you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more
  information, see [Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES
