defmodule AWS.DevOpsGuru do
  @moduledoc """
  Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous
  behavior in business critical operational applications.

  You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to
  cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail
  events related to those resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is
  detected, DevOps Guru creates an *insight* that includes recommendations,
  related events, and related metrics that can help you improve your operational
  applications. For more information, see [What is Amazon DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html).

  You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are
  notified every time a new insight is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to
  generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each insight to
  help you manage and track your work addressing insights.

  To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see [How DevOps Guru works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works).
  To learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see [Concepts in DevOps Guru](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/concepts.html).
