  Amazon Security Lake is in preview release.

  Your use of the Security Lake preview is subject to Section 2 of the [Amazon Web Services Service Terms](http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)("Betas and
  Previews").

  Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You can use
  Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises,
  and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your Amazon Web
  Servicesaccount. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account management
  service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an
  organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you can
  create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization.
  Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding
  of your security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you
  improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data.

  The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets,
  and you retain ownership over your data.

  Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that provides a
  record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service in
  Security Lake CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The
  calls captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to
  the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable
  continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including
  events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the
  most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the
  information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made
  to Security Lake, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the
  request, when it was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security
  Lake information in CloudTrail, see the [Amazon Security Lake User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html).

  Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data
  from integrated Amazon Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you
  manage the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication
  settings. Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a
  standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework
  (OCSF).

  Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data
  that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data
  analytics.

  Adds a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security Lake source.

  Enables source types for member accounts in required Amazon Web Services
  Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can choose any source type in
  any Region for either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or
  standalone accounts. At least one of the three dimensions is a mandatory input
  to this API. However, you can supply any combination of the three dimensions to
  this API.

  By default, a dimension refers to the entire set. When you don't provide a
  dimension, Security Lake assumes that the missing dimension refers to the entire
  set. This is overridden when you supply any one of the inputs. For instance,
  when you do not specify members, the API enables all Security Lake member
  accounts for all sources. Similarly, when you do not specify Regions, Security
  Lake is enabled for all the Regions where Security Lake is available as a
  service.

  You can use this API only to enable natively supported Amazon Web Services as a
  source. Use `CreateCustomLogSource` to enable data collection from a custom

  Initializes an Amazon Security Lake instance with the provided (or default)

  You can enable Security Lake in Amazon Web Services Regions with customized

  `enableAll` parameter to specify all Regions or specify the Regions where you
  want to enable Security Lake. To specify particular Regions, use the `Regions`
  parameter and then configure these Regions using the `configurations` parameter.
  If you have already enabled Security Lake in a Region when you call this

  parameters. If you have not already enabled Security Lake in the Region when you

  storing data, and making data accessible to subscribers. Security Lake also

  your Amazon Web Services account in the current Region, including security log
