  AWS Step Functions

  AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of
  distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.

  You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components,
  each of which performs a discrete function, or *task*, allowing you to scale and
  change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps
  visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step
  Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when
  there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right
  order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly
  diagnose and debug any issues.

  Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your
  application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on AWS, your own
  servers, or any system that has access to AWS. You can access and use Step
  Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information
  about Step Functions, see the * [AWS Step Functions Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/welcome.html) *.

  Creates an activity.

  An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any
  machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step
  Functions using the `GetActivityTask` API action and respond using `SendTask*`
  API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your
  activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling
  from the activity.

  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not
  reflect very recent updates and changes.

  `CreateActivity` is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a
  duplicate resource if it was already created. `CreateActivity`'s idempotency
  check is based on the activity `name`. If a following request has different
  `tags` values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an
  idempotent request of the previous. In this case, `tags` will not be updated,
  even if they are different.

  Creates a state machine.

  A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (`Task`
  states), determine to which states to transition next (`Choice` states), stop an
  execution with an error (`Fail` states), and so on. State machines are specified
  using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see [Amazon States
  Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html)
  in the AWS Step Functions User Guide.

  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not

  `CreateStateMachine` is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a
  duplicate resource if it was already created. `CreateStateMachine`'s idempotency
  check is based on the state machine `name`, `definition`, `type`,
  `LoggingConfiguration` and `TracingConfiguration`. If a following request has a
  different `roleArn` or `tags`, Step Functions will ignore these differences and
  treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, `roleArn` and
  `tags` will not be updated, even if they are different.

  Used by workers to retrieve a task (with the specified activity ARN) which has
  been scheduled for execution by a running state machine.

  This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and
  responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of
  this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request
  before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the
  poll returns a `taskToken` with a null string.

  Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5
  seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request).

  Polling with `GetActivityTask` can cause latency in some implementations. See
  [Avoid Latency When Polling for Activity Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/bp-activity-pollers.html)
