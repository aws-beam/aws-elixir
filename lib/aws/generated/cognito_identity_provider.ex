  Alternatively, you can call `AdminCreateUser` with `SUPPRESS` for the
  `MessageAction` parameter, and Amazon Cognito won't send any email.

  In either case, the user will be in the `FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD` state until they

  deactivate is a linked external identity provider (IdP) user, any link between
  that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no

  create a new user account. See

  The `ProviderName` must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the

  To deactivate a native username + password user, the `ProviderName` value must
  be `Cognito` and the `ProviderAttributeName` must be `Cognito_Subject`. The
  `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the name that is used in the user pool for the
  user.

  The `ProviderAttributeName` must always be `Cognito_Subject` for social identity
  providers. The `ProviderAttributeValue` must always be the exact subject that
  was used when the user was originally linked as a source user.

  For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity
  has not yet been used to sign in, the `ProviderAttributeName` and
