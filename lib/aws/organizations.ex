  AWS Organizations API Reference

  AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your
  multiple AWS accounts into an *organization* and centrally manage your
  accounts and their resources.

  This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more
  information about using this service, see the [AWS Organizations User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html).

  **API Version**

  This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations
  API version 2016-11-28.

  <note> As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the
  AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
  programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and
  more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
  AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically
  signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For
  more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install
  them, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  </note> We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API
  calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query
  API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more
  about the Organizations Query API, see [Making Query
  Requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*. Organizations supports GET and POST
  requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET
  for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to
  the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger
  sizes, use a POST request.

  **Signing Requests**

  When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS
  can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key,
  which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
  recommend that you do not create an access key for your root account.
  Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access
  to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an
  IAM user account that has administrative privileges. As another option, use
  AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials, and
  use those credentials to sign requests.

  To sign requests, we recommend that you use [Signature Version
  4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
  If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do
  not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations
  now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that
  require version 4 indicate this requirement.

  When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS
  SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests
  for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools.

  In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future
  release, a single organization will support multiple roots.

  **Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations**

  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to
  [feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com](mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com)
  or post your feedback and questions in the [AWS Organizations support
  forum](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219). For more
  information about the AWS support forums, see [Forums
  Help](http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa).

  **Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API**

  For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the `us-east-1`
  region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the CLI by using
  these parameters and commands:

  <ul> <li> Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the
  endpoint and its region:

  `--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

  </li> <li> Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with
  this command:

  `aws configure set default.region us-east-1`

  </li> <li> Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
  endpoint:

  `--region us-east-1`

  </li> </ul> For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the
  documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests
  to a specific endpoint. For more information, see [Regions and
  Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region)
  in the *AWS General Reference*.

  **How examples are presented**

  The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your
  requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or
  formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the
  examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input
  parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond the
  screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always
  submit the input as a single JSON text string.

  **Recording API Requests**

  AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API
  calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket.
  By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which
  requests were successfully made to Organizations, who made the request,
  when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its
  support for AWS CloudTrail, see [Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS
  CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*. To learn more about CloudTrail,
  including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [AWS
  CloudTrail User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).

  Sends a response to the originator of a handshake agreeing to the action
  proposed by the handshake request.

  This operation can be called only by the following principals when they
  also have the relevant IAM permissions:

  <ul> <li> **Invitation to join** or **Approve all features request**
  handshakes: only a principal from the member account.

  The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the
  `organizations:AcceptHandshake` permission. If you enabled all features in
  the organization, then the user must also have the
  `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission so that Organizations can create
  the required service-linked role named *AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations*.
  For more information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked
  Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integration_services.html#orgs_integration_service-linked-roles)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

  </li> <li> **Enable all features final confirmation** handshake: only a
  principal from the master account.

  For more information about invitations, see [Inviting an AWS Account to
  Join Your
  Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_invites.html)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*. For more information about requests

  Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual
  account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:

  <ul> <li> **Service control policy (SCP)** - An SCP specifies what
  permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The
  scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:

  <ul> <li> If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the
  organization.

  </li> <li> If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that
  OU and in any child OUs.

  </li> <li> If you attach the policy directly to an account, then it affects
  only that account.

  </li> </ul> SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for
  an organization or organizational unit (OU). When you attach one SCP to a
  higher level root or OU, and you also attach a different SCP to a child OU
  or to an account, the child policy can further restrict only the
  permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the
  child. An SCP that is attached to a child cannot grant a permission that is
  not already granted by the parent. For example, imagine that the parent SCP
  allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and
  G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to
  use only C, D, and E. They cannot use A or B because they were filtered out
  by the child OU. They also cannot use F and G because they were filtered
  out by the parent OU. They cannot be granted back by the child SCP; child
  SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.

  AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named `"FullAWSAccess` to every
  root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions,
  enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the
  parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it
  with a policy that specifies the permissions that you want to allow in that
  OU or account.

  For more information about how Organizations policies permissions work, see
  [Using Service Control
  Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html)

  Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization
  whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that
  AWS performs in the background. Because `CreateAccount` operates
  asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though
  account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a
  few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the
  status of the request, do one of the following:

  <ul> <li> Use the `OperationId` response element from this operation to
  provide as a parameter to the `DescribeCreateAccountStatus` operation.

  </li> <li> Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the `CreateAccountResult`
  event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see

  Organization](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_monitoring.html)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide.*

  </li> </ul> <p/> The user who calls the API to create an account must have
  the `organizations:CreateAccount` permission. If you enabled all features
  in the organization, AWS Organizations will create the required
  service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. For more
  information, see [AWS Organizations and Service-Linked
  Roles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs)
  in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

  AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named
  `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` by default) that grants users in the master
  account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in
  the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the
  company name and address information for the new account from the
  organization's master account.

  This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.

  the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information
  required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a
  payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is *not*
  automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your
  organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing
  information. Follow the steps at [ To leave an organization as a member

  because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try
  again. If the error persists, contact [AWS
  Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/).

  </li> <li> Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't
