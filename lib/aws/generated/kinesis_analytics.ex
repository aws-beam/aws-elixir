  Adds an external destination to your Amazon Kinesis Analytics application.

  If you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an in-application
  stream within your application to an external destination (such as an Amazon
  Kinesis stream, an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda
  function), you add the relevant configuration to your application using this
  operation. You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each
  output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination.

  You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your
  in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze
  the errors. For more information, see [Understanding Application Output (Destination)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-output.html).

  Any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this
  operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the
  [DescribeApplication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/API_DescribeApplication.html) operation to find the current application version.

  For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can
  configure, see
  [Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/limits.html).

  Adds a reference data source to an existing application.

  Amazon Kinesis Analytics reads reference data (that is, an Amazon S3 object) and
  creates an in-application table within your application. In the request, you
  provide the source (S3 bucket name and object key name), name of the
  in-application table to create, and the necessary mapping information that
  describes how data in Amazon S3 object maps to columns in the resulting
  in-application table.

  Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each
  application with one streaming source as input, application code to process the
  input, and up to three destinations where you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to
  write the output data from your application. For an overview, see [How it Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works.html).

  In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an in-application
  stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating table. In the mapping,
  you must provide a schema for the in-application stream and map each data column
  in the in-application stream to a data element in the streaming source.

  Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input data,
  transform it, and generate output. Your application code can create one or more
  SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps.

  In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write data
  from in-application streams created in your applications to up to three
  destinations.

  To read data from your source stream or write data to destination streams,
  Amazon Kinesis Analytics needs your permissions. You grant these permissions by
  creating IAM roles. This operation requires permissions to perform the
  `kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication` action.
