  Amazon Relational Database Service

  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes
  it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
  It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard
  relational database and manages common database administration tasks,
  freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and
  businesses unique.

  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB,
  PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server.
  These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already
  use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without
  modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains
  the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible:
  you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to
  meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are
  no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.

  This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a
  programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS.
  Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require
  techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a
  command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions
  indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance
  reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as
  follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.

  Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

  To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
  `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
  of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

  You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. In
  that case, the AWS Region where you call the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action
  is the destination AWS Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be
  copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS
  Region, you must provide the following values:

  <ul> <li> `KmsKeyId` - The AWS Key Management System (AWS KMS) key
  identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster
  snapshot in the destination AWS Region.

  </li> <li> `PreSignedUrl` - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4
  signed request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action to be called in the
  source AWS Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The
  pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` API
  action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the
  encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied.

  The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:

  <ul> <li> `KmsKeyId` - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt
  the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is
  the same identifier for both the `CopyDBClusterSnapshot` action that is
  called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the
  pre-signed URL.

  </li> <li> `DestinationRegion` - The name of the AWS Region that the DB
  cluster snapshot is to be created in.

  </li> <li> `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot
  identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This
  identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source
  AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster
  snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your
  `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` looks like the following example:
  `arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115`.

  </li> </ul> To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request,
  see [ Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature
  Version
  4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)
  and [ Signature Version 4 Signing
  Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  <note> If you are using an AWS SDK tool or the AWS CLI, you can specify
  `SourceRegion` (or `--source-region` for the AWS CLI) instead of specifying
  `PreSignedUrl` manually. Specifying `SourceRegion` autogenerates a
  pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the operation that can be
  executed in the source AWS Region.

  </note> </li> <li> `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for
  the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region.

  </li> <li> `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot
  identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This
  identifier must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region and is the
  same value as the `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` in the pre-signed
  URL.

  </li> </ul> To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the
  target DB cluster snapshot identified by
  `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` while that DB cluster snapshot is in
  "copying" status.

  Creates a new DB cluster parameter group.

  Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in
  a DB cluster.

  A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default
  parameters for the database engine used by instances in the DB cluster. To
  provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group
  after creating it using `ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup`. Once you've
  created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB
  cluster using `ModifyDBCluster`. When you associate a new DB cluster
  parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB
  instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster
  parameter group and associated settings to take effect.

  <important> After you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait
  at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB

  RDS to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter
