  Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and
  managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service.

  Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in
  the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services
  Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and tables
  in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing
  software.

  In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via
  open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition
  language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web
  Services SDK and CLI. This API reference describes the supported DDL operations
  in detail.

  For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see [Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types in Amazon
  Keyspaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html)
  in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

  To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see
  [Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#service-name-info-in-cloudtrail)
  in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

  implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see

  The `CreateKeyspace` operation adds a new keyspace to your account.

  In an Amazon Web Services account, keyspace names must be unique within each
  Region.

  `CreateKeyspace` is an asynchronous operation. You can monitor the creation
  status of the new keyspace by using the `GetKeyspace` operation.

  The `CreateTable` operation adds a new table to the specified keyspace.

  Within a keyspace, table names must be unique.

  `CreateTable` is an asynchronous operation. When the request is received, the
  status of the table is set to `CREATING`. You can monitor the creation status of
  the new table by using the `GetTable` operation, which returns the current
  `status` of the table. You can start using a table when the status is `ACTIVE`.

  or `UPDATING` states, then Amazon Keyspaces returns a `ResourceInUseException`.
  If the specified table does not exist, Amazon Keyspaces returns a
  `ResourceNotFoundException`. If the table is already in the `DELETING` state, no

  Restores the specified table to the specified point in time within the
  `earliest_restorable_timestamp` and the current time.

  For more information about restore points, see [ Time window for PITR continuous backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_window)
  in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

  Any number of users can execute up to 4 concurrent restores (any type of
  restore) in a given account.

  When you restore using point in time recovery, Amazon Keyspaces restores your
  source table's schema and data to the state based on the selected timestamp
  `(day:hour:minute:second)` to a new table. The Time to Live (TTL) settings are
  also restored to the state based on the selected timestamp.

  In addition to the table's schema, data, and TTL settings, `RestoreTable`
  restores the capacity mode, encryption, and point-in-time recovery settings from
  the source table. Unlike the table's schema data and TTL settings, which are
  restored based on the selected timestamp, these settings are always restored
  based on the table's settings as of the current time or when the table was
  deleted.

  You can also overwrite these settings during restore:

  • Read/write capacity mode

  • Provisioned throughput capacity settings

  • Point-in-time (PITR) settings

  • Tags

  For more information, see [PITR restore settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/PointInTimeRecovery_HowItWorks.html#howitworks_backup_settings)
  in the *Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide*.

  Note that the following settings are not restored, and you must configure them
  manually for the new table:

  • Automatic scaling policies (for tables that use provisioned capacity mode)

  • Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies

  • Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms
