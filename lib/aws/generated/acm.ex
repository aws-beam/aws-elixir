  Adds one or more tags to an ACM certificate.

  Tags are labels that you can use to identify and organize your Amazon Web
  Services resources. Each tag consists of a `key` and an optional `value`. You
  specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You specify
  the tag by using a key-value pair.

  You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific
  characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple
  certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those
  certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you
  want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add
  the same tag to an ACM certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer
  to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information,
  see [Tagging ACM certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html).

  To remove one or more tags, use the `RemoveTagsFromCertificate` action. To view
  all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the
  `ListTagsForCertificate` action.

  Imports a certificate into Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager (ACM) to use
  with services that are integrated with ACM.

  Note that [integrated services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html)
  allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their
  resources. Further, their support differs depending on whether the certificate
  is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information, see the documentation
  for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM,
  see [Importing Certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager User Guide*.

  ACM does not provide [managed renewal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html) for
  certificates that you import.

  Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:

    * You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you
  are importing.

    * The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private
  key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.

    * The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).

    * If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must
  enter its certificate chain.

    * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject
  of one of the certificates in the chain.

    * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be
  PEM-encoded.

    * The current time must be between the `Not Before` and `Not After`
  certificate fields.

    * The `Issuer` field must not be empty.

    * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000
  characters.

    * To import a new certificate, omit the `CertificateArn` argument.
  Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported
  certificate.

    * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify
  the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key by their file names
  preceded by `fileb://`. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the
  `C:\temp` folder as `fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem`. If you are
  making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.

    * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify
  the certificate, the certificate chain, and the private key files in the manner
  required by the programming language you're using.

    * The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match
  the algorithm of the signing CA. For example, if the signing CA key type is RSA,
  then the certificate key type must also be RSA.

  This operation returns the [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
  of the imported certificate.

  Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services.

  To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name
  (FQDN) in the `DomainName` parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in
  the `SubjectAlternativeNames` parameter.

  If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required.
  If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify
  must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use [DNS validation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html)
