  The CreatePreset operation creates a preset with settings that you specify.

  <important> Elastic Transcoder checks the CreatePreset settings to ensure
  that they meet Elastic Transcoder requirements and to determine whether
  they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings are not valid for
  Elastic Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400 response
  (`ValidationException`) and does not create the preset. If the settings are
  valid for Elastic Transcoder but aren't strictly compliant with the H.264
  standard, Elastic Transcoder creates the preset and returns a warning
  message in the response. This helps you determine whether your settings
  comply with the H.264 standard while giving you greater flexibility with
  respect to the video that Elastic Transcoder produces.

  </important> Elastic Transcoder uses the H.264 video-compression format.
