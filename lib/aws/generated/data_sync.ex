  AWS DataSync

  AWS DataSync is a managed data transfer service that makes it simpler for
  you to automate moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon Simple
  Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).

  This API interface reference for AWS DataSync contains documentation for a
  programming interface that you can use to manage AWS DataSync.

  Cancels execution of a task.

  When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly
  interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination
  might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you
  start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task
  execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and
  consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task
  execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the
  transfer when you start the next task execution.

  Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The
  activation process associates your agent with your account. In the
  activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you
  want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region
  where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks
  are created in this AWS Region.

  You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the
  agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the
  public internet.

  You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple
  agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If
  you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents
  must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.

  Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a
  mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

  Creates a task. A task is a set of two locations (source and destination)
  and a set of Options that you use to control the behavior of a task. If you
  don't specify Options when you create a task, AWS DataSync populates them
  with service defaults.

  When you create a task, it first enters the CREATING state. During CREATING
  AWS DataSync attempts to mount the on-premises Network File System (NFS)
  location. The task transitions to the AVAILABLE state without waiting for
  the AWS location to become mounted. If required, AWS DataSync mounts the
  AWS location before each task execution.

  If an agent that is associated with a source (NFS) location goes offline,
  the task transitions to the UNAVAILABLE status. If the status of the task
  remains in the CREATING status for more than a few minutes, it means that
  your agent might be having trouble mounting the source NFS file system.
  Check the task's ErrorCode and ErrorDetail. Mount issues are often caused
  by either a misconfigured firewall or a mistyped NFS server hostname.
