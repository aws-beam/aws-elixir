  Amazon Elastic Container Registry

  Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image
  registry service.

  Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred client, to push,
  pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable
  registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR
  supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using IAM so that
  specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can access repositories and images.

  Amazon ECR has service endpoints in each supported Region. For more information,
  see [Amazon ECR endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html) in the
  *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.
