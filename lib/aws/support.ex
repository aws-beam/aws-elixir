  AWS Support

  The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed
  information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service
  enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP
  methods that return results in JSON format.

  <note> <ul> <li> You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use
  the AWS Support API.

  </li> <li> If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not
  have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the
  `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information
  about changing your support plan, see [AWS
  Support](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/).

  </li> </ul> </note> The AWS Support service also exposes a set of [AWS
  Trusted Advisor](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/)
  features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get
  check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of
  checks.

  The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:

  <ul> <li> **Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.
  **The `DescribeServices` and `DescribeSeverityLevels` operations return AWS
  service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity
  levels. You use these values when you call the `CreateCase` operation.

  </li> <li> **Case creation, case details, and case resolution.** The
  `CreateCase`, `DescribeCases`, `DescribeAttachment`, and `ResolveCase`
  operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and
  resolve cases.

  </li> <li> **Case communication.** The `DescribeCommunications`,
  `AddCommunicationToCase`, and `AddAttachmentsToSet` operations retrieve and
  add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.

  </li> </ul> The following list describes the operations available from the
  AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:

  <ul> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks` returns the list of checks that
  run against your AWS resources.

  </li> <li> Using the `checkId` for a specific check returned by
  `DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks`, you can call
  `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult` to obtain the results for the check
  that you specified.

  </li> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries` returns summarized
  results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

  </li> <li> `RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck` requests that Trusted Advisor rerun
  a specified check.

  </li> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses` reports the refresh
  status of one or more checks.

  </li> </ul> For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses [Signature
  Version 4 Signing
  Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  See [About the AWS Support
  API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html) in
  the *AWS Support User Guide* for information about how to use this service
  to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor
  for results of checks on your resources.

  Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set.

  An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to
  a case or case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's
  created. The `expiryTime` returned in the response is when the set expires.

  <note> <ul> <li> You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan to use
  the AWS Support API.

  </li> <li> If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not
  have a Business or Enterprise support plan, the
  `SubscriptionRequiredException` error message appears. For information
  about changing your support plan, see [AWS

  can list a set of email addresses to copy on the communication by using the

  text of the communication.

  Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how
  you create a case in the AWS Support Center [Create
  Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

  The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You
  can submit a service limit increase in the following ways:

  <ul> <li> Submit a request from the AWS Support Center [Create
  Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

  </li> <li> Use the Service Quotas
  [RequestServiceQuotaIncrease](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html)
  operation.

  </li> </ul> A successful `CreateCase` request returns an AWS Support case
  number. You can use the `DescribeCases` operation and specify the case
  number to get existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the
  `AddCommunicationToCase` operation to add additional communication or
  attachments to an existing case.

  The `caseId` is separate from the `displayId` that appears in the [AWS
  Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support). Use the
  `DescribeCases` operation to get the `displayId`.
