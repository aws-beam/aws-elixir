  Config

  Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the Amazon Web
  Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

  You can use Config to get the current and historical configurations of each
  Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship
  between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute
  Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic
  network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources
  currently supported by Config, see [Supported Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources).

  You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management
  Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services
  CLI), the Config API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference
  guide contains documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI
  commands that you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the Signature
  Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign
  a request with this protocol, see [Signature Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).
  For detailed information about Config features and their associated actions or
  commands, as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console,
  see [What Is Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
  in the *Config Developer Guide*.

  the *Config Developer Guide*.

  There are two types of rules: Config Custom Rules and Config Managed Rules. You
  can use `PutConfigRule` to create both Config custom rules and Config managed
  rules.

  Custom rules are rules that you can create using either Guard or Lambda
  functions. Guard ([Guard GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)) is a
  policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies that are enforced by
  Config Custom Policy rules. Lambda uses custom code that you upload to evaluate
  a custom rule. If you are adding a new Custom Lambda rule, you first need to
  create an Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. When
  you use `PutConfigRule` to add a Custom Lambda rule to Config, you must specify
  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. You specify
  the ARN in the `SourceIdentifier` key. This key is part of the `Source` object,
  which is part of the `ConfigRule` object.

  Managed rules are predefined, customizable rules created by Config. For a list
  of managed rules, see [List of Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).
  If you are adding an Config managed rule, you must specify the rule's identifier
  for the `SourceIdentifier` key.

  For any new rule that you add, specify the `ConfigRuleName` in the `ConfigRule`
  object. Do not specify the `ConfigRuleArn` or the `ConfigRuleId`. These values
  are generated by Config for new rules.

  If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule
  by `ConfigRuleName`, `ConfigRuleId`, or `ConfigRuleArn` in the `ConfigRule` data
  type that you use in this request.
