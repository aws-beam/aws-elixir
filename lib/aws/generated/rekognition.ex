  Compares a face in the *source* input image with each of the 100 largest faces
  detected in the *target* input image.

  If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest
  face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.

  CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false
  negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low
  similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To
  reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the
  target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use `CompareFaces`
  to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to
  services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and
  further validation before taking action.

  You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as
  references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call
  Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image
  must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by
  similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides
  a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and
  yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the
  level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also
  provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.

  By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80%
  are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the
  `SimilarityThreshold` parameter.

  `CompareFaces` also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image.
  For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose
  details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in
  the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.

  The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that
  donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of
  common use cases. Use `QualityFilter` to set the quality bar by specifying
  `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or `HIGH`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify
  `NONE`. The default value is `NONE`.

  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, `CompareFaces` returns orientation
  information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the
  images with the correct image orientation.

  If no faces are detected in the source or target images, `CompareFaces` returns
  an `InvalidParameterException` error.

  This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation
  doesn't persist.

  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition
  Developer Guide.

  For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a
  (`CustomLabel`) object in an array (`CustomLabels`). Each `CustomLabel` object
  provides the label name (`Name`), the level of confidence that the image
  contains the object (`Confidence`), and object location information, if it
  exists, for the label on the image (`Geometry`).

  To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for `MinConfidence`.
  `DetectCustomLabelsLabels` only returns labels with a confidence that's higher
  than the specified value. The value of `MinConfidence` maps to the assumed
  threshold values created during training. For more information, see *Assumed
  threshold* in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon
  Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an assumed threshold as a floating
  point value between 0-1. The range of `MinConfidence` normalizes the threshold
  value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from
  `DetectCustomLabels` are also returned as a percentage. You can use

  Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided

  This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding,
  graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and
  nature.

  For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon
  Rekognition Developer Guide.

  `DetectLabels` does not support the detection of activities. However, activity
  detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see
  StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an
  image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition
  operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG
  or JPEG formatted file.

  For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each
  label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image
  contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the
  sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.

  `{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}`

  `{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}`

  ` {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}`

  In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three
  objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in
  the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a
  tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.

  `{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}`

  `{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}`

  `{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}`

  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as
  a tulip.

  In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also
  includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify `MinConfidence`
  to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%.
  You can also add the `MaxLabels` parameter to limit the number of labels
  returned.

  If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same
  facial details that the `DetectFaces` operation provides.

  `DetectLabels` returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in
  an array of `Instance` objects. An `Instance` object contains a `BoundingBox`
  object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the
  confidence by which the bounding box was detected.

  `DetectLabels` also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For
  example, a detected car might be assigned the label *car*. The label *car* has
  two parent labels: *Vehicle* (its parent) and *Transportation* (its
  grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label.
  Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, *Car*,
  *Vehicle*, and *Transportation* are returned as unique labels in the response.

  A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated

  `GetCelebrityRecognition` returns detected celebrities and the time(s) they are
  detected in an array (`Celebrities`) of `CelebrityRecognition` objects. Each
  `CelebrityRecognition` contains information about the celebrity in a
  `CelebrityDetail` object and the time, `Timestamp`, the celebrity was detected.
  This `CelebrityDetail` object stores information about the detected celebrity's
  face attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a
  confidence estimate.

  `GetCelebrityRecognition` only returns the default facial attributes
  (`BoundingBox`, `Confidence`, `Landmarks`, `Pose`, and `Quality`). The
  `BoundingBox` field only applies to the detected face instance. The other facial
  attributes listed in the `Face` object of the following response syntax are not

  Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.

  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the
  underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For
  each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and
  stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when
  it performs face match and search operations using the `SearchFaces` and
  `SearchFacesByImage` operations.

  For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition
  Developer Guide.

  To get the number of faces in a collection, call `DescribeCollection`.

  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, `IndexFaces` indexes
  the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection
  model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.

  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation
  information is not returned in the `OrientationCorrection` field.

  To determine which version of the model you're using, call `DescribeCollection`
  and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value
  of `FaceModelVersion` in the response from `IndexFaces`

  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer
  Guide.

  If you provide the optional `ExternalImageId` for the input image you provided,
  Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you
  call the `ListFaces` operation, the response returns the external ID. You can
  use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces
  with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image.

  You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the `MaxFaces` input
  parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image
  and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people
  standing in the background.

  The `QualityFilter` input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that
  donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of
  common use cases. By default, `IndexFaces` chooses the quality bar that's used
  to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use
  `QualityFilter`, to set the quality bar by specifying `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, or
  `HIGH`. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify `NONE`.

  To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the
  face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a
  collection, call `DescribeCollection`.

  Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an
  array of `UnindexedFace` objects, `UnindexedFaces`. Faces aren't indexed for
  reasons such as:

    * The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the `MaxFaces`
  request parameter.

    * The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.

    * The face is too blurry.

    * The image is too dark.

    * The face has an extreme pose.

    * The face doesnâ€™t have enough detail to be suitable for face
  search.

  In response, the `IndexFaces` operation returns an array of metadata for all
  detected faces, `FaceRecords`. This includes:

    * The bounding box, `BoundingBox`, of the detected face.

    * A confidence value, `Confidence`, which indicates the confidence
  that the bounding box contains a face.

    * A face ID, `FaceId`, assigned by the service for each face that's
  detected and stored.

    * An image ID, `ImageId`, assigned by the service for the input
  image.

  If you request all facial attributes (by using the `detectionAttributes`
  parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as
  facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial
  attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use
  the same external ID in the `IndexFaces` operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't
  save duplicate face metadata.

  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a
  reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call

  Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

  Amazon Rekognition Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are instances of
  real-world entities. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events
  like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; concepts like landscape, evening,
  and nature; and activities like a person getting out of a car or a person
  skiing.

  The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use `Video` to specify the
  bucket name and the filename of the video. `StartLabelDetection` returns a job
  identifier (`JobId`) which you use to get the results of the operation. When
  label detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion
  status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in
  `NotificationChannel`.

  To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status
  value published to the Amazon SNS topic is `SUCCEEDED`. If so, call
  `GetLabelDetection` and pass the job identifier (`JobId`) from the initial call
  to `StartLabelDetection`.
