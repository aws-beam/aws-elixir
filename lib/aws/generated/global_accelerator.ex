  This is the *AWS Global Accelerator API Reference*.

  This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global
  Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about
  Global Accelerator features, see the [AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html).

  AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve
  availability and performance of your applications for local and global users.

  You must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.

  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you
  associate with your accelerator. (Instead of using the IP addresses that Global
  Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses
  from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator.) The
  static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network and distribute
  incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS
  Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints can be
  Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP
  addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions.

  Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal
  regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you
  configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to
  ensure that internet traffic from clients is directed to only healthy endpoints.

  Global Accelerator includes components that work together to help you improve
  performance and availability for your applications:

  ## Definitions

  ### Static IP address

  By default, AWS Global Accelerator provides you with a set of static IP
  addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network and serve as the single
  fixed entry points for your clients. Or you can configure these entry points to
  be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global
  Accelerator (BYOIP). For more information, see [Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html)
  in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide*. If you already have load
  balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses set up for your applications,
  you can easily add those to Global Accelerator to allow the resources to be
  accessed by the static IP addresses.

  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
  exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
  traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP
  addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using
  them. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who
  have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see
  [Authentication and Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/auth-and-access-control.html)
  in the *AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide*.

  ### Accelerator

  An accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network
  to improve availability and performance for your internet applications that have
  a global audience. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.

  ### DNS name

  Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS)
  name, similar to `a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com`, that points to
  your Global Accelerator static IP addresses. Depending on the use case, you can
  use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your
  accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain
  name.

  ### Network zone

  A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a
  unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an
  isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an
  accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it.
  If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address
  blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client
  applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated
  network zone.

  ### Listener

  A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator,
  based on the protocol and port that you configure. Each listener has one or more
  endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one
  of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the
  Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to
  optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

  ### Endpoint group

  Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups
  include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the
  percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by
  adjusting a setting called a *traffic dial*. The traffic dial lets you easily do
  performance testing or blue/green deployment testing for new releases across
  different AWS Regions, for example.

  ### Endpoint

  An endpoint is a Network Load Balancer, Application Load Balancer, EC2 instance,
  or Elastic IP address. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on several factors,
  including the geo-proximity to the user, the health of the endpoint, and the
  configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each
  endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to
  specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for
  example, to do performance testing within a Region.

  Delete an accelerator.

  Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all

  update the accelerator to set `Enabled` to false.

  When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with
  a set of two static IP addresses. Alternatively, you can bring your own IP
  address ranges to Global Accelerator and assign IP addresses from those ranges.

  The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even
  if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic.
  However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that
  are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using

  inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global
  Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
