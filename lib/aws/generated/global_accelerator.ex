  This is the *AWS Global Accelerator API Reference*.

  This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global
  Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about
  Global Accelerator features, see the [AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/Welcome.html).

  AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create *accelerators* to
  improve the performance of your applications for local and global users.
  Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional
  benefits.

    * By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of
  your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
  accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the
  AWS global network.

    * For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing
  accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to
  directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.

  Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS
  Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update
  accelerators.

  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that
  you associate with your accelerator. With a standard accelerator, instead of
  using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these
  entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring
  to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge
  network. For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application
  traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which
  increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard
  accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon
  EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or
  multiple Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives
  to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are
  virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
  exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
  traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP
  addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using
  them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global
  Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
  For more information, see [Tag-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html).

  For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to
  route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location,
  and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in
  health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always
  directed to healthy endpoints.

  For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are
  currently supported, see the [AWS Region Table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/).

  AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:

  ## Definitions

  ### Static IP addresses

  Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are
  anycast from the AWS edge network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS
  (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you can instead assign IP addresses
  from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, see [
  Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global
  Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html).

  The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you
  already have Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or
  Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add
  those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global
  Accelerator to use static IP addresses to access the resources.

  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
  exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
  traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP
  addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using
  them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global
  Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see [Tag-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html).

  ### Accelerator

  An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to
  improve the performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes
  one or more listeners.

  There are two types of accelerators:

     A *standard* accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS
  endpoint based on several factors, including the userâ€™s location, the health of
  the endpoint, and the endpoint weights that you configure. This improves the
  availability and performance of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load
  Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP
  addresses.

     A *custom routing* accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly
  thousands of Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual
  private clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to
  statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global
  Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of connection.
  By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC subnet can't receive traffic.
  You can choose to configure all destinations in the subnet to receive traffic,
  or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic.

  For more information, see [Types of accelerators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/introduction-accelerator-types.html).

  ### DNS name

  Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS)
  name, similar to `a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com`, that points to
  the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you
  choose from your own IP address range. Depending on the use case, you can use
  your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your
  accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain
  name.

  ### Network zone

  A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a
  unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an
  isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an
  accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it.
  If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address
  blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client
  applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated
  network zone.

  ### Listener

  A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator,
  based on the port (or port range) and protocol (or protocols) that you
  configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP
  protocols. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and
  traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint
  groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute
  traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal
  endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

  ### Endpoint group

  Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups
  include one or more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you
  can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise
  directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a *traffic dial*.
  The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment
  testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions.

  ### Endpoint

  An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to.

  Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application
  Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application
  Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for standard
  accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the endpoint along
  with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each
  endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to
  specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for
  example, to do performance testing within a Region.

  Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC)
  subnets with one or many EC2 instances.
