defmodule AWS.Detective do
  @moduledoc """
  Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help
  you analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services
  (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as
  login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and
  Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts
  findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

  The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of
  behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of
  member accounts, and is created and managed by a master account.

  Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to
  manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the
  currently selected endpoint.

  A Detective master account can use the Detective API to do the following:

  <ul> <li> Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new
  behavior graph.

  </li> <li> View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.

  </li> <li> Add member accounts to a behavior graph.

  </li> <li> Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.

  </li> </ul> A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:

  <ul> <li> View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.

  </li> <li> Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

  </li> <li> Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

  </li> <li> Remove their account from a behavior graph.

  </li> </ul> All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See [Logging
  Detective API Calls with
  CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

  Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account

  enabling Detective.

  Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been
  enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this
  requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty
  prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks
  whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the
  quota, then you cannot enable Detective.

  The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the
  currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.

  `CreateGraph` triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables
  for the new behavior graph.

  Region. If the same account calls `CreateGraph` with the same master
  account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create
