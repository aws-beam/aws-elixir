# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [v0.9.2] - 2021-10-27

### Fixed

- Fix decoding of UTF8 chars when parsing XML responses.

## [v0.9.1] - 2021-10-26

### Fixed

- Fix encode of payload for GET/HEAD/OPTIONS requests. It shouldn't be encoded
because the body should be empty. This fixes a signature error problem.

## [v0.9.0] - 2021-09-01

### Added

- Add support for configuring the endpoint used by `AWS.Client`.
This change enable the usage of AWS compatible APIs.

### Changed

- Move functions and modules related to AWS Signature to a new package
and add this package - [`aws_signature`](https://hex.pm/packages/aws_signature) - as a new dependency.

### Fixed

- Fix encode of URIs to use the correct escaping rule.

## [v0.8.0] - 2021-07-18
### Added
- Add support for OTP 24 by updating the usage of `:crypto` functions to the new API.
- Add support for more services - update to be in sync with [aws-sdk-go 1.40.2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.40.2).

### Changed
- Change `AWS.Client` port value to an integer instead of string.
- Use "us-east-1" as default region for global services.
- Improve ExDocs configuration for a better documentation.

### Fixed
- Skip decoding of "REST" responses when body is binary.
- Fix HEAD requests for the default HTTP client.
- Fix "content-type" for "REST" requests that have the body as binary. It uses
"application/octet-stream" now.
- Fix handle of HTTP status from requests - consider anything in the
range of 2xx as successful, but check for exact status if the service requires one.
- Fix two signature bugs: when the headers are similar and when the canonical URL
has colons (:).

## [v0.7.0] - 2020-12-22
### Added
- Add support for more AWS APIs. There are more than 170 new modules, which includes
the majority of AWS services.
- Load AWS credentials from env if available.
- Add header `X-Amz-Content-SHA256` required for APIs using the rest-xml protocol.
- Handle querystring parameters.
- Allow the user to configure the HTTP client, as well as the JSON parser.

### Backwards Incompatible Changed
- Update structure of error response from `{:error, {exception, reason}}` to `{:error, {:unexpected_response, response}}`.
  - You can obtained the previous `exception` and `reason` in this version by decoding the `response.body`, where `exception` is mapped to `response.body["__type"]` and `reason` is mapped to `response.body["message"]`.
- Update module naming for certain AWS services. E.g.:
  - `AWS.Cognito` is renamed to `AWS.CognitoIdentity`  
  - `AWS.Cognito.IdentityProvider` is renamed to `AWS.CognitoIdentityProvider`

### Changed
- Improve documentation by using more markdown and removing HTML tags.
- Rename modules and function names to consider the correct use of abbreviations, like SQS or DB.
- Migrate to Jason (JSON parser) and hackney (HTTP client) as the default dependencies. Hackney
is an optional dependency.

### Fixed
- Fixed the way we send the payload to endpoints that accepts binaries as body (S3
is an example).
- Normalize querystring when signing.
- Remove duplicated headers.

## [v0.6.0] - 2020-08-20
### Added
- Includes support for more AWS APIs.

### Fixed
- Pass security token for signed POST requests.

## [v0.5.0] - 2017-03-07
### Fixed
- `AWS.APIGateway` module uses a service URL without a trailing slash
  (apparently AWS behaviour with regard to URL signing is
  inconsistent). Thanks Richard Foster (@zuren).
