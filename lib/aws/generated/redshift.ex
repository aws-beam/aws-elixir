  Amazon Redshift

  **Overview**

  This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains
  documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can
  use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is
  asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such
  as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command
  has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate
  whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or
  during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift
  cluster management interfaces, go to [Using the Amazon Redshift Management
  Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html).

  Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling
  a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the
  cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine.
  You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business
  and customers.

  If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you
  begin by reading the [Amazon Redshift Getting Started
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html).

  If you are a database developer, the [Amazon Redshift Database Developer
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html)
  explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make
  up your data warehouse.

  Adds an inbound (ingress) rule to an Amazon Redshift security group.
  Depending on whether the application accessing your cluster is running on
  the Internet or an Amazon EC2 instance, you can authorize inbound access to
  either a Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)/Internet Protocol (IP) range
  or to an Amazon EC2 security group. You can add as many as 20 ingress rules
  to an Amazon Redshift security group.

  If you authorize access to an Amazon EC2 security group, specify
  *EC2SecurityGroupName* and *EC2SecurityGroupOwnerId*. The Amazon EC2
  security group and Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same AWS Region.

  If you authorize access to a CIDR/IP address range, specify *CIDRIP*. For
  an overview of CIDR blocks, see the Wikipedia article on [Classless
  Inter-Domain
  Routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

  You must also associate the security group with a cluster so that clients
  running on these IP addresses or the EC2 instance are authorized to connect
  to the cluster. For information about managing security groups, go to
  [Working with Security
  Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-security-groups.html)

  Creates an Amazon Redshift event notification subscription. This action

  Amazon SNS and subscribe to the topic. The ARN is displayed in the SNS
  console.
