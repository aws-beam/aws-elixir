  Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes
  it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to
  stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane.

  Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and
  management of containerized applications.

  Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so
  you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community.
  Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications
  running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises
  data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any
  standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification
  required.

  Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.

  The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the
  Kubernetes software, such as `etcd` and the API server. The control plane runs
  in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed
  by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is
  single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances.

  The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and
  fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also
  provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide
  connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to
  support `kubectl exec`, `logs`, and `proxy` data flows).

  Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your
  cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a
  certificate file that is created for your cluster.

  In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an
  Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate
  with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more information,
  see [Managing Cluster Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html)
  and [Launching Amazon EKS nodes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html) in

  Creates an Fargate profile for your Amazon EKS cluster.

  You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods
  on Fargate.

  The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate
  and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done
  through the profileâ€™s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that
  contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The
  label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the
  selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the
  selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

  When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use
  with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the
  cluster's Kubernetes [Role Based Access Control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/) (RBAC) for
  authorization so that the `kubelet` that is running on the Fargate
  infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear
  in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions
  to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image
  repositories. For more information, see [Pod Execution Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-execution-role.html)
  in the *Amazon EKS User Guide*.

  Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to
  replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated
  profile has finished creating.

  If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the `DELETING` status, you must wait
  for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other
  profiles in that cluster.
