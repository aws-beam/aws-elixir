  AWS Support

  The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed
  information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service
  enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP
  methods that return results in JSON format.

  The AWS Support service also exposes a set of [Trusted
  Advisor](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/) features.
  You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check
  results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.

  The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:

  <ul> <li> **Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels.
  **The `DescribeServices` and `DescribeSeverityLevels` operations return AWS
  service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity
  levels. You use these values when you call the `CreateCase` operation.

  </li> <li> **Case creation, case details, and case resolution.** The
  `CreateCase`, `DescribeCases`, `DescribeAttachment`, and `ResolveCase`
  operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and
  resolve cases.

  </li> <li> **Case communication.** The `DescribeCommunications`,
  `AddCommunicationToCase`, and `AddAttachmentsToSet` operations retrieve and
  add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.

  </li> </ul> The following list describes the operations available from the
  AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:

  <ul> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks` returns the list of checks that
  run against your AWS resources.

  </li> <li> Using the `checkId` for a specific check returned by
  `DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks`, you can call
  `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult` to obtain the results for the check you
  specified.

  </li> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries` returns summarized
  results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.

  </li> <li> `RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck` requests that Trusted Advisor rerun
  a specified check.

  </li> <li> `DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses` reports the refresh
  status of one or more checks.

  </li> </ul> For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses [Signature
  Version 4 Signing
  Process](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  See [About the AWS Support
  API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/Welcome.html) in the
  *AWS Support User Guide* for information about how to use this service to
  create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for
  results of checks on your resources.

  Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set. If an `attachmentSetId`
  is not specified, a new attachment set is created, and the ID of the set is
  returned in the response. If an `attachmentSetId` is specified, the
  attachments are added to the specified set, if it exists.

  An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that are to be
  added to a case or case communication. The set is available for one hour
  after it is created; the `expiryTime` returned in the response indicates
  when the set expires. The maximum number of attachments in a set is 3, and
  the maximum size of any attachment in the set is 5 MB.

  Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. You use the
  `caseId` value to identify the case to add communication to. You can list a
  set of email addresses to copy on the communication using the
  `ccEmailAddresses` value. The `communicationBody` value contains the text
  of the communication.

  The response indicates the success or failure of the request.

  This operation implements a subset of the features of the AWS Support
  Center.

  Creates a new case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is modeled on
  the behavior of the AWS Support Center [Create
  Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page. Its
  parameters require you to specify the following information:

  <ul> <li> **issueType.** The type of issue for the case. You can specify
  either "customer-service" or "technical." If you do not indicate a value,
  the default is "technical."

  </li> <li> **serviceCode.** The code for an AWS service. You obtain the
  `serviceCode` by calling `DescribeServices`.

  </li> <li> **categoryCode.** The category for the service defined for the
  `serviceCode` value. You also obtain the category code for a service by
  calling `DescribeServices`. Each AWS service defines its own set of
  category codes.

  </li> <li> **severityCode.** A value that indicates the urgency of the
  case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service
  level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling
  `DescribeSeverityLevels`.

  </li> <li> **subject.** The **Subject** field on the AWS Support Center
  [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create)
  page.

  </li> <li> **communicationBody.** The **Description** field on the AWS
  Support Center [Create
  Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) page.

  </li> <li> **attachmentSetId.** The ID of a set of attachments that has
  been created by using `AddAttachmentsToSet`.

  </li> <li> **language.** The human language in which AWS Support handles
  the case. English and Japanese are currently supported.

  </li> <li> **ccEmailAddresses.** The AWS Support Center **CC** field on the
  [Create Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create)
  page. You can list email addresses to be copied on any correspondence about
  the case. The account that opens the case is already identified by passing
  the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method or function call
  from one of the programming languages supported by an [AWS
  SDK](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  </li> </ul> <note> To add additional communication or attachments to an
  existing case, use `AddCommunicationToCase`.

  </note> A successful `CreateCase` request returns an AWS Support case
  number. Case numbers are used by the `DescribeCases` operation to retrieve
  existing AWS Support cases.

  Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachment IDs are

  `afterTime` and `beforeTime` request parameters. You can set values for the
  `includeResolvedCases` and `includeCommunications` request parameters to
  control how much information is returned.

  Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created
  more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.

  The response returns the following in JSON format:

  <ul> <li> One or more `CaseDetails` data types.

  the returned records represented by the `CaseDetails` objects.
