:deciduous_tree: With this library you can talk to almost all AWS services without hassle. :zap:

## Features

* A clean API separated per service. Each module has a correspondent service.
* Support for most of AWS services.
* Configurable HTTP client and JSON parser.
* Generated by [aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) using the
  same JSON descriptions of AWS services used to build the
  [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models/apis).
* Documentation is updated from the official AWS docs.

## Usage

Here is an example of listing Amazon Kinesis streams. First you need to start a
console with `iex -S mix`.

After that, type the following:

```elixir
iex> client = AWS.Client.create("your-access-key-id", "your-secret-access-key", "us-east-1")
iex> {:ok, result, resp} = AWS.Kinesis.list_streams(client, %{})
iex> IO.inspect(result)
%{"HasMoreStreams" => false, "StreamNames" => []}
```

If you are using `Amazon.S3`, you can upload a file with integrity check doing:

```elixir
iex> client = AWS.Client.create("your-access-key-id", "your-secret-access-key", "us-east-1")
iex> file =  File.read!("./tmp/your-file.txt")
iex> md5 = :crypto.hash(:md5, file) |> Base.encode64()
iex> AWS.S3.put_object(client, "your-bucket-name", "foo/your-file-on-s3.txt",
  %{"Body" => file, "ContentMD5" => md5})
```

## Installation

Add `:aws` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`. It also requires
[hackney](https://github.com/benoitc/hackney) for the default HTTP client.
Optionally, you can implement your own (Check `AWS.Client` docs).

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aws, "~> 0.7.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.17"}
  ]
end
```

Run `mix deps.get` to install.

## Development

Most of the code is generated using the
[aws-codegen](https://github.com/aws-beam/aws-codegen) library from the JSON
descriptions of AWS services provided by Amazon. They can be found in
`lib/aws/generated`.

Code outside `lib/aws/generated` is manually written and used as support for
the generated code.

## Documentation

Online
* [Hex Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/aws)

Local
* Run `mix docs`
* Open `docs/index.html`

__Note:__ Arguments, errors and response structure can be found by viewing the model schemas used to generate this module at `aws-sdk-go/models/apis/<aws-service>/<version>/`.

An example is [`aws-sdk-go/models/apis/rekognition/2016-06-27/api-2.json`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/models/apis/rekognition/2016-06-27/api-2.json).
Alternatively you can access the documentation for the service you want at [AWS docs page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/).

## Tests

```
mix test
```

## Release

* Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` is up-to-date and and reflects the changes for
  the new version.
* Bump the version here in the `README.md` and in `mix.exs`.
* Run `git tag v$VERSION` to tag the version that was just published.
* Run `git push --tags origin master` to push tags to Github.
* Run `mix hex.publish` to publish the new version.
