  Authorizes the DDoS Response Team (DRT), using the specified role, to access
  your AWS account to assist with DDoS attack mitigation during potential attacks.

  This enables the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF configuration and create or update

  You can associate only one `RoleArn` with your subscription. If you submit an
  `AssociateDRTRole` request for an account that already has an associated role,
  the new `RoleArn` will replace the existing `RoleArn`.

  [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy) managed policy to the role you will specify in the request. For more information
  see [Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies](
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html).
  The role must also trust the service principal ` drt.shield.amazonaws.com`. For
  more information, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html).

  The DRT will have access only to your AWS WAF and Shield resources. By
  submitting this request, you authorize the DRT to inspect your AWS WAF and
