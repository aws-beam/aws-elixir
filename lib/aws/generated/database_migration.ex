  AWS Database Migration Service

  AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can migrate your data to and from
  the most widely used commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle,
  PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora,
  MySQL, and SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). The service supports
  homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous
  migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or
  SQL Server to PostgreSQL.

  For more information about AWS DMS, see [What Is AWS Database Migration
  Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) in
  the *AWS Database Migration User Guide.*
