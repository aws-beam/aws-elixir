  Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services)
  resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time.

  You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you
  want to measure for your resources and applications.

  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you
  are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the
  CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this
  data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle
  increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save
  money.

  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web
  Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain
  system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and
  operational health.

  Deletes the specified alarms.

  You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can
  include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99
  metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete
  two composite alarms with one operation.

  In the event of an error, no alarms are deleted.

  It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite
  alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on
  composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that
  is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that
  depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

  To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of
  one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the
  cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule`
  of one of the alarms to `False`.

  Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a
  cycle in the evaluation path.

  the Invocations metric to get an error rate time series. For more information
  about metric math expressions, see [Metric Math Syntax and Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html#metric-math-syntax)
  in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

  Calls to the `GetMetricData` API have a different pricing structure than calls
  to `GetMetricStatistics`. For more information about pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

  Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

    * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available
  for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available
  only for custom metrics that have been defined with a `StorageResolution` of 1.

    * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available
  for 15 days.

    * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available
  for 63 days.

    * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available
  for 455 days (15 months).

  Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated
  together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period
  of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution.
  After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable
  only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further
  aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour.

  If you omit `Unit` in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is
  returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data
  was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only
  data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that
  does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null.

  Gets statistics for the specified metric.

  The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If you
  request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To reduce the
  number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple
  requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period.
  Data points are not returned in chronological order.

  CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you
  specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period,
  CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
  one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is
  larger than the number of data points returned.

  CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you
  publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile
  statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

    * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.

    * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

  Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric

  Creates or updates a *composite alarm*.

  When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm
  that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created.
  The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are
  met.

  The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include metric
  alarms and other composite alarms.

  Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric
  alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the
  composite alarm. For example, you could create a composite alarm that goes into
  ALARM state only when more than one of the underlying metric alarms are in ALARM
  state.

  Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms are
  notifying SNS topics.

  It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite
  alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on
  composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that
  is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that
  depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

  To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of
  one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the
  cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the `AlarmRule`
  of one of the alarms to `False`.

  Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a
  cycle in the evaluation path.

  When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to
  `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`. The alarm is then evaluated and its state is set
  appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state are then executed. For
  a composite alarm, this initial time after creation is the only time that the
  alarm can be in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state.

  When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the update
  completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

  To use this operation, you must be signed on with the
  `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission that is scoped to `*`. You can't
  create a composite alarms if your `cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm` permission has
  a narrower scope.

  are creating the alarm.

    * The account where you are creating the alarm (the *monitoring
  account*) must already have a service-linked role named
  **AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount** to allow CloudWatch to assume the
  sharing role in the sharing account. If it does not, you must create it

  Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch.

  CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric. If the
  specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric. When CloudWatch
  creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in
  calls to
  [ListMetrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html).  You can publish either individual data points in the `Value` field, or arrays of
  values and the number of times each value occurred during the period by using
  the `Values` and `Counts` fields in the `MetricDatum` structure. Using the
  `Values` and `Counts` method enables you to publish up to 150 values per metric
  with one `PutMetricData` request, and supports retrieving percentile statistics
  on this data.

  Each `PutMetricData` request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests.
  You can send a payload compressed by gzip. Each request is also limited to no
  more than 20 different metrics.

  Although the `Value` parameter accepts numbers of type `Double`, CloudWatch
  rejects values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the
  range of -2^360 to 2^360. In addition, special values (for example, NaN,
  +Infinity, -Infinity) are not supported.

  You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the
  metric collects. Each dimension consists of a Name and Value pair. For more
  information about specifying dimensions, see [Publishing
  Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html)
  in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

  You specify the time stamp to be associated with each data point. You can
  specify time stamps that are as much as two weeks before the current date, and
  as much as 2 hours after the current day and time.

  Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least 48

  Creates or updates a metric stream.

  Metric streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web
  Services destinations including Amazon S3 and to many third-party solutions.

  For more information, see [ Using Metric Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Metric-Streams.html).

  To create a metric stream, you must be logged on to an account that has the
  `iam:PassRole` permission and either the `CloudWatchFullAccess` policy or the
  `cloudwatch:PutMetricStream` permission.

  When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:

    * Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.

    * Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except
  for the namespaces that you list in `ExcludeFilters`.

    * Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in
  `IncludeFilters`.

  When you use `PutMetricStream` to create a new metric stream, the stream is
  created in the `running` state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the
  state of the stream is not changed.

  Temporarily sets the state of an alarm for testing purposes.

  When the updated state differs from the previous value, the action configured
  for the appropriate state is invoked. For example, if your alarm is configured
  to send an Amazon SNS message when an alarm is triggered, temporarily changing
  the alarm state to `ALARM` sends an SNS message.

  Metric alarms returns to their actual state quickly, often within seconds.
  Because the metric alarm state change happens quickly, it is typically only
  visible in the alarm's **History** tab in the Amazon CloudWatch console or
  through
  [DescribeAlarmHistory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAlarmHistory.html).

  If you use `SetAlarmState` on a composite alarm, the composite alarm is not
  guaranteed to return to its actual state. It returns to its actual state only
  once any of its children alarms change state. It is also reevaluated if you
  update its configuration.

  If an alarm triggers EC2 Auto Scaling policies or application Auto Scaling
  policies, you must include information in the `StateReasonData` parameter to
  enable the policy to take the correct action.

  Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch resource.

  Currently, the only CloudWatch resources that can be tagged are alarms and
  Contributor Insights rules.

  Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them
  to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only
  resources with certain tag values.

  Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted
  strictly as strings of characters.

  You can use the `TagResource` action with an alarm that already has tags. If you
  specify a new tag key for the alarm, this tag is appended to the list of tags
  associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated
  with the alarm, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value
  for that tag.

  You can associate as many as 50 tags with a CloudWatch resource.
