  Removes the specified tags from the specified resources.

  When you specify a tag key, the action removes both that key and its associated
  value. The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a resource
  that were already removed. Note the following:

    * To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions
  for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for removing
  tags. For more information, see the documentation for the service whose resource
  you want to untag.

    * You can only tag resources that are located in the specified AWS
  Region for the calling AWS account.

  ## Minimum permissions

  In addition to the `tag:UntagResources` permission required by this operation,
  you must also have the remove tags permission defined by the service that
  created the resource. For example, to remove the tags from an Amazon EC2
  instance using the `UntagResources` operation, you must have both of the
  following permissions:
