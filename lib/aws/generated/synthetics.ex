  Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics

  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services.

  You can create and manage *canaries*, which are modular, lightweight scripts
  that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your
  canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the
  availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by
  investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The
  canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the
  causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more information, see [Using ServiceLens to Monitor the Health of Your
  Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html)
  in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.

  Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations.
  For more information, see [Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html).

  Creates a canary.

  Canaries are scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in.
  Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and
  troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI,
  logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.

  Do not use `CreateCanary` to modify an existing canary. Use
  [UpdateCanary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateCanary.html) instead.

  To create canaries, you must have the `CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess` policy.
  If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the the
  `iam:CreateRole`, `iam:CreatePolicy` and `iam:AttachRolePolicy` permissions. For
  more information, see [Necessary Roles and
  Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Roles).

  Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The
  canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and
  the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information,
  see [Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html).

  When you delete a canary, resources used and created by the canary are not
  automatically deleted. After you delete a canary that you do not intend to use
  again, you should also delete the following:

  the prefix `cwsyn-*MyCanaryName* `.

  name of `Synthetics-SharpDrop-Alarm-*MyCanaryName* `.
