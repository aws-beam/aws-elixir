  This is the Amazon Lookout for Vision API Reference.

  It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common

  Amazon Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in industrial
  products, accurately and at scale. It uses computer vision to identify missing
  components in an industrial product, damage to vehicles or structures,
  irregularities in production lines, and even minuscule defects in silicon wafers
  â€” or any other physical item where quality is important such as a missing
  capacitor on printed circuit boards.

  Adds or updates one or more JSON Line entries in a dataset.

  A JSON Line includes information about an image used for training or testing an
  Amazon Lookout for Vision model.

  To update an existing JSON Line, use the `source-ref` field to identify the JSON
  Line. The JSON line that you supply replaces the existing JSON line. Any
  existing annotations that are not in the new JSON line are removed from the
  dataset.

  For more information, see *Defining JSON lines for anomaly classification* in
  the Amazon Lookout for Vision Developer Guide.

  The images you reference in the `source-ref` field of a JSON line, must be in
  the same S3 bucket as the existing images in the dataset.

  Updating a dataset might take a while to complete. To check the current status,
  call `DescribeDataset` and check the `Status` field in the response.

  This operation requires permissions to perform the
  `lookoutvision:UpdateDatasetEntries` operation.
