  Amazon Cognito Sync

  Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable
  cross-device syncing of application-related user data.

  High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use
  these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the
  device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile
  device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized
  user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up
  to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user
  identity.

  With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only
  to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync
  service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with [Amazon Cognito Identity
  service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

  If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will
  probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the
  [Developer Guide for Android](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html)
  and the [Developer Guide for iOS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html).
