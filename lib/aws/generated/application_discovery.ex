  Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service

  Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service helps you plan application
  migration projects.

  It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
  dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the
  [Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/). Application Discovery
  Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your
  on-premises servers:

    * **Agentless discovery** is recommended for environments that use
  VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each
  host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.

      * Agentless discovery gathers server information
  regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for
  initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.

      * Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about
  network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.

    * **Agent-based discovery** collects a richer set of data than
  agentless discovery by using the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
  Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.

      * The agent captures infrastructure and application
  information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance
  information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.

      * The information collected by agents is secured at rest
  and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.

    * **Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions** integrate
  with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your
  on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery
  connector or discovery agent.

      * Third-party application discovery tools can query
  Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the
  Application Discovery Service database using the public API.

      * In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub
  and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track
  migrations.

  ## Recommendations

  We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and
  whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run
  agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to
  complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents
  on select hosts to collect additional information.

  ## Working With This Guide

  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of
  the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each
  action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can
  use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the
  programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see
  [Amazon Web Services SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs).     Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before
  you call any of these APIs.

     You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
  associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a
  `HomeRegionNotSetException` error is returned.

     API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
  permitted outside of your home region.

     Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could
  change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an `InvalidInputException` is
  returned.

     You must call `GetHomeRegion` to obtain the latest Migration Hub
  home region.

  This guide is intended for use with the [Amazon Web Services Application
  Discovery Service User
  Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/).

  All data is handled according to the [Amazon Web Services Privacy Policy](http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/). You can operate Application Discovery
  Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.

  Starts an import task, which allows you to import details of your on-premises
  environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub without having to
  use the Application Discovery Service (ADS) tools such as the Discovery
  Connector or Discovery Agent.

  This gives you the option to perform migration assessment and planning directly
  from your imported data, including the ability to group your devices as
  applications and track their migration status.

  To start an import request, do this:

    1. Download the specially formatted comma separated value (CSV)
  import template, which you can find here:
  [https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates-7cffcf56-bd96-4b1c-b45b-a5b42f282e46/import_template.csv).     2. Fill out the template with your server and application data.

    3. Upload your import file to an Amazon S3 bucket, and make a note
  of it's Object URL. Your import file must be in the CSV format.

    4. Use the console or the `StartImportTask` command with the Amazon
  Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to import the records
  from your file.
