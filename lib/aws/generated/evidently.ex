  You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by
  serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the
  feature.

  You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to
  ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you reduce risk and identify
  unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.

  You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on
  evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once.
  Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It
  also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You
  can test both user-facing features and backend features.

  This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions.

  For each user session, you pass in an `entityID` that represents the user.

  The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the user's
  `entityID` matches an override rule, the user is served the variation specified
  by that rule.

  Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a

  Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch Evidently
  resource.

  Projects, features, launches, and experiments can be tagged.

  Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them
  to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only
  resources with certain tag values.

  Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted
  strictly as strings of characters.

  You can use the `TagResource` action with a resource that already has tags. If
  you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of
  tags associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already
  associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the
  previous value for that tag.

  You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource.

  For more information, see [Tagging Amazon Web Services resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html).
