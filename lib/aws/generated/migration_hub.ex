  The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application
  migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by
  providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

  Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you
  call any of these APIs, or a `HomeRegionNotSetException` error will be
  returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.

  Associates a created artifact of an AWS cloud resource, the target
  receiving the migration, with the migration task performed by a migration
  tool. This API has the following traits:

  <ul> <li> Migration tools can call the `AssociateCreatedArtifact` operation
  to indicate which AWS artifact is associated with a migration task.

  </li> <li> The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon
  Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region;
  for example: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b`.
