defmodule AWS.SecurityHub do
  @moduledoc """
  Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of
  your AWS environment and resources.

  It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on
  controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data
  from AWS accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you
  analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority
  security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the * [AWS Security Hub User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)
  *.

  When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only
  in the AWS Region that is currently active or in the specific AWS Region that
  you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results
  from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in
  other Regions, execute the same command for each Region to apply the change to.

  For example, if your Region is set to `us-west-2`, when you use `
  `CreateMembers` ` to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of
  the member account with the master account is created only in the `us-west-2`
  Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region
  that the invitation was sent from.

  The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.

    * ` `BatchEnableStandards` ` - `RateLimit` of 1 request per second,
  `BurstLimit` of 1 request per second.

    * ` `GetFindings` ` - `RateLimit` of 3 requests per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 6 requests per second.

    * ` `UpdateFindings` ` - `RateLimit` of 1 request per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 5 requests per second.

    * ` `UpdateStandardsControl` ` - `RateLimit` of 1 request per
  second, `BurstLimit` of 5 requests per second.

    * All other operations - `RateLimit` of 10 requests per second.
  `BurstLimit` of 30 requests per second.
