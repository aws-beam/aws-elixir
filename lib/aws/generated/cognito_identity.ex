  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities

  Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped
  temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments.
  It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent
  identity over the lifetime of an application.

  Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication
  with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login
  with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to
  support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique
  identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by
  AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
  credentials.

  For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito
  Developer Guide see [Authentication
  Flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html).

  For more information see [Amazon Cognito Federated
  Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html).

  merged. If the users to be merged are associated with the same public
  provider, but as two different users, an exception will be thrown.

  Assigns a set of tags to an Amazon Cognito identity pool. A tag is a label
  that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in different ways,

  Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a
  general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two
  versions of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production,
  you might assign an `Environment` tag key to both identity pools. The value
  of this key might be `Test` for one identity pool and `Production` for the
  other.

  Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your
  tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where
  you can track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM
  policy, you can constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific
  tags or tag values.

  pool can have as many as 50 tags.
