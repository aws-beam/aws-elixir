  CodeBuild

  CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud.

  CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts
  that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage,
  and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for
  the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven,
  Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild
  to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build
  requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information
  about CodeBuild, see the * [CodeBuild User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html).*

  If you enable webhooks for an CodeBuild project, and the project is used as a
  build step in CodePipeline, then two identical builds are created for each
  commit. One build is triggered through webhooks, and one through CodePipeline.
  Because billing is on a per-build basis, you are billed for both builds.
  Therefore, if you are using CodePipeline, we recommend that you disable webhooks
  in CodeBuild. In the CodeBuild console, clear the Webhook box. For more

  in the *CodeBuild User Guide*.

  The following should be kept in mind when making your projects public:

     All of a project's build results, logs, and artifacts, including
  builds that were run when the project was private, are available to the general
  public.

     All build logs and artifacts are available to the public.
  Environment variables, source code, and other sensitive information may have
  been output to the build logs and artifacts. You must be careful about what
  information is output to the build logs. Some best practice are:

       Do not store sensitive values, especially Amazon Web
  Services access key IDs and secret access keys, in environment variables. We
  recommend that you use an Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets
  Manager to store sensitive values.

       Follow [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/webhooks.html#webhook-best-practices)
  in the *CodeBuild User Guide* to limit which entities can trigger a build, and
  do not store the buildspec in the project itself, to ensure that your webhooks
  are as secure as possible.

     A malicious user can use public builds to distribute malicious
  artifacts. We recommend that you review all pull requests to verify that the
  pull request is a legitimate change. We also recommend that you validate any
  artifacts with their checksums to make sure that the correct artifacts are being
  downloaded.
