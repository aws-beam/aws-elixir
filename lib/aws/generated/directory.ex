  Directory Service

  Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run
  directories in the Amazon Web Services cloud, or connect your Amazon Web
  Services resources with an existing self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.

  This guide provides detailed information about Directory Service operations,
  data types, parameters, and errors. For information about Directory Services
  features, see [Directory Service](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and the [Directory Service Administration
  Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html).

  Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android,
  etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to
  Directory Service and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information
  about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them,
  see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
