  can also create your own applications on top of the Catalog API to manage your

  same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a `ChangeSet` is running, all the
  entities targeted by the different changes are locked until the change set has
  completed (either succeeded, cancelled, or failed). If you try to start a change
  set containing a change against an entity that is already locked, you will
  receive a `ResourceInUseException` error.

  For example, you can't start the `ChangeSet` described in the
  [example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples) later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same change type
