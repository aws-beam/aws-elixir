  The Cost Explorer API enables you to programmatically query your cost and usage
  data.

  You can query for aggregated data such as total monthly costs or total daily
  usage. You can also query for granular data, such as the number of daily write
  operations for Amazon DynamoDB database tables in your production environment.

  Service Endpoint

  The Cost Explorer API provides the following endpoint:

    * `https://ce.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

  For information about costs associated with the Cost Explorer API, see [AWS Cost Management Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/pricing/).

  Gets recommendations for which reservations to purchase.

  These recommendations could help you reduce your costs. Reservations provide a
  discounted hourly rate (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing.

  AWS generates your recommendations by identifying your On-Demand usage during a
  specific time period and collecting your usage into categories that are eligible
  for a reservation. After AWS has these categories, it simulates every
  combination of reservations in each category of usage to identify the best
  number of each type of RI to purchase to maximize your estimated savings.

  For example, AWS automatically aggregates your Amazon EC2 Linux, shared tenancy,
  and c4 family usage in the US West (Oregon) Region and recommends that you buy
  size-flexible regional reservations to apply to the c4 family usage. AWS
  recommends the smallest size instance in an instance family. This makes it
  easier to purchase a size-flexible RI. AWS also shows the equal number of
  normalized units so that you can purchase any instance size that you want. For
  this example, your RI recommendation would be for `c4.large` because that is the
  smallest size instance in the c4 instance family.
