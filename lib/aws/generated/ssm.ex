  Systems Manager simplifies application and resource management, shortens the
  time to detect and resolve operational problems, and helps you manage your
  Amazon Web Services resources securely at scale.

  This reference is intended to be used with the [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/).

  Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource.

  *Tags* are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed
  nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines.
  Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by
  purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
  value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for
  your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack
  level. For example:

    * `Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin`

    * `Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin`

    * `Key=Owner,Value=Dev`

    * `Key=Stack,Value=Production`

    * `Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production`

    * `Key=Stack,Value=Test`

  Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of
  5 tags.

  We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each
  resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to
  manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags
  you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as
  a string of characters.

  For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
  EC2) instances, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html)

  A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain on your

  For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be
  installed and running on your managed nodes, or that certain ports must be
  closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the
  configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services
  resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a
  capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when
  new managed nodes are added to the group. The association also specifies actions
  to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for
  anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then
  State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't
  running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.

  A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single
  location.

  Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync:
  `SyncToDestination` and `SyncFromSource`.

  You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the `SyncToDestination` type
  to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a
  single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information,
  see [Configuring resource data sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

  You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the `SyncFromSource` type to
  synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData)
  from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This
  type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple Amazon Web Services
  accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions or `EntireOrganization` by using
  Organizations. For more information, see [Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and
  Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide*.

  A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately.
  After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs
  data. To check the status of a sync, use the `ListResourceDataSync`.

  By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you
  enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend
  that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket
  policy.

  parameter. For example, if version 1 has the label Production, then you can't

  attach a label to a specific version of a parameter.

    * If you no longer want to use a parameter label, then you can
  either delete it or move it to a different version of a parameter.

    * A label can have a maximum of 100 characters.

    * Labels can contain letters (case sensitive), numbers, periods (.),
  hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

    * Labels can't begin with a number, "`aws`" or "`ssm`" (not case

  Updates an association.

  You can update the association name and version, the document version, schedule,
  parameters, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) output. When you call
  `UpdateAssociation`, the system removes all optional parameters from the request
  and overwrites the association with null values for those parameters. This is by
  design. You must specify all optional parameters in the call, even if you are
  not changing the parameters. This includes the `Name` parameter. Before calling
  this API action, we recommend that you call the `DescribeAssociation` API
  operation and make a note of all optional parameters required for your
  `UpdateAssociation` call.

  In order to call this API operation, your Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  user account, group, or role must be configured with permission to call the
