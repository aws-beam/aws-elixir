  To delete an S3 bucket policy, see
  [DeleteBucketPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketPolicy.html) in the *Amazon S3 API Reference*.

  This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete
  the policy of a specified Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket. If you are using an
  identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
  the bucket, the calling identity must have the `s3-outposts:DeleteBucketPolicy`
  permissions on the specified Outposts bucket and belong to the bucket owner's
  account to use this action. For more information, see [Using Amazon S3 on
  Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
  in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  If you don't have `DeleteBucketPolicy` permissions, Amazon S3 returns a `403
  Access Denied` error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using
  an identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `405
  Method Not Allowed` error.

  As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that
  owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies
  the root user the ability to perform this action.

  This action gets a bucket policy for an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket.

  To get a policy for an S3 bucket, see

  If you are using an identity other than the root user of the Amazon Web Services
  account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
  `GetBucketPolicy` permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the bucket
  owner's account in order to use this action.

  perform actions on an Outposts bucket. If you don't have
  `s3-outposts:GetBucketPolicy` permissions or you're not using an identity that
  belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a `403 Access Denied`
  error.

  As a security precaution, the root user of the Amazon Web Services account that
  owns a bucket can always use this action, even if the policy explicitly denies
  the root user the ability to perform this action.

  Use tags to organize your Amazon Web Services bill to reflect your own cost
  structure. To do this, sign up to get your Amazon Web Services account bill with
  tag key values included. Then, to see the cost of combined resources, organize
  your billing information according to resources with the same tag key values.
  For example, you can tag several resources with a specific application name, and
  then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application
  across several services. For more information, see [Cost allocation and tagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html).

  Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an existing tag, the

  tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html).

  Sets the supplied tag-set on an S3 Batch Operations job.

  A tag is a key-value pair. You can associate S3 Batch Operations tags with any
  job by sending a PUT request against the tagging subresource that is associated
  with the job. To modify the existing tag set, you can either replace the
  existing tag set entirely, or make changes within the existing tag set by
  retrieving the existing tag set using
  [GetJobTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_GetJobTagging.html), modify that tag set, and use this action to replace the tag set with the one you

  tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/batch-ops-managing-jobs.html#batch-ops-job-tags)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    * If you send this request with an empty tag set, Amazon S3 deletes
  the existing tag set on the Batch Operations job. If you use this method, you
  are charged for a Tier 1 Request (PUT). For more information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

    * For deleting existing tags for your Batch Operations job, a
  [DeleteJobTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_DeleteJobTagging.html) request is preferred because it achieves the same result without incurring
  charges.

    * A few things to consider about using tags:

      * Amazon S3 limits the maximum number of tags to 50 tags
  per job.

      * You can associate up to 50 tags with a job as long as
  they have unique tag keys.

      * A tag key can be up to 128 Unicode characters in
  length, and tag values can be up to 256 Unicode characters in length.

      * The key and values are case sensitive.

      * For tagging-related restrictions related to characters
  and encodings, see [User-Defined Tag
  Restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/allocation-tag-restrictions.html)

  this action replaces any existing policy that is associated with the specified
  Multi-Region Access Point.
