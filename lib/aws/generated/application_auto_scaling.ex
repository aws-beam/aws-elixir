  With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for the
  following resources:

    * Amazon AppStream 2.0 fleets

    * Amazon Aurora Replicas

    * Amazon Comprehend document classification and entity recognizer
  endpoints

    * Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes throughput
  capacity

    * Amazon ECS services

    * Amazon ElastiCache for Redis clusters (replication groups)

    * Amazon EMR clusters

    * Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) tables

    * Lambda function provisioned concurrency

    * Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka broker storage

    * Amazon Neptune clusters

    * Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants

    * Spot Fleets (Amazon EC2)

    * Custom resources provided by your own applications or services

  ## API Summary

  The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:

    * Register and manage scalable targets - Register Amazon Web
  Services or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application
  Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve
  information on existing scalable targets.

    * Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies
  to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule
  one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity
  history.

    * Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume
  automatic scaling by calling the
  [RegisterScalableTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_RegisterScalableTarget.html) API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and
  resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are triggered
  by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy,
  and scheduled scaling.

  granting IAM users required permissions for Application Auto Scaling actions,

  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/what-is-application-auto-scaling.html).

  Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable
  target.

  Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and
  scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified
  by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have
  registered the resource as a scalable target.

  Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable
  target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more
  step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple
  policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at
  the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that
  provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if
  one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200
  percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the
  policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to
  30.

  We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with
  step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause
  undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a
  scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the
  scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes,
  the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out
  again.

  For more information, see [Target tracking scaling policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html)
  and [Step scaling policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-step-scaling-policies.html)

  Registers or updates a scalable target.

  A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale out and
  scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of
  resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.

  When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for minimum and
  maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted within the specified range
  when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling scaling policies will not scale
  capacity to values that are outside of this range.

  After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it again to
  use other Application Auto Scaling operations. To see which resources have been
  registered, use
  [DescribeScalableTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html). You can also view the scaling policies for a service namespace by using
  [DescribeScalableTargets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DescribeScalableTargets.html).
  If you no longer need a scalable target, you can deregister it by using
  [DeregisterScalableTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_DeregisterScalableTarget.html).

  To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that you want to change.
  Include the parameters that identify the scalable target: resource ID, scalable
  dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed
  by this update request.

  If you call the `RegisterScalableTarget` API to update an existing scalable
  target, Application Auto Scaling retrieves the current capacity of the resource.
  If it is below the minimum capacity or above the maximum capacity, Application
  Auto Scaling adjusts the capacity of the scalable target to place it within
  these bounds, even if you don't include the `MinCapacity` or `MaxCapacity`
  request parameters.
