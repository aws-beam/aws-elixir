  AWS Key Management Service

  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management
  web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call
  programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the [ *AWS Key
  Management Service Developer Guide*
  ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).

  <note> AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS,
  Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic
  access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care
  of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and
  retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
  including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web
  Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  </note> We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API
  calls to AWS KMS.

  Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS
  1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy
  (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral
  Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later
  support these modes.

  **Signing Requests**

  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key.
  We strongly recommend that you *do not* use your AWS account (root) access
  key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the
  access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the
  AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that
  you can use to sign requests.

  All AWS KMS operations require [Signature Version
  4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  **Logging API Requests**

  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and
  related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3
  bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail,
  you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request,
  when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how
  to turn it on and find your log files, see the [AWS CloudTrail User
  Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

  **Additional Resources**

  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the
  following:

  used for accessing AWS.

  </li> <li> [Temporary Security
  Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html)

  </li> </ul> **Commonly Used API Operations**

  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the
  most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other
  than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the
  console.

  <ul> <li> `Encrypt`

  </li> <li> `Decrypt`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKey`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`

  Connects or reconnects a [custom key
  store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster.

  The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer
  master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can
  disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time.

  To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must
  have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a
  cluster, use the
  [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html)
  operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the
  [CreateHsm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html)
  operation. Also, the [ `kmsuser` crypto
  user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser)
  (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using
  this account to log in.

  The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up
  to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does
  not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly
  returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However,
  this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To
  get the connection state of the custom key store, use the
  `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation.

  During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that
  is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection
  infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client
  as the `kmsuser` CU, and rotates its password.

  The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons. To
  find the reason, use the `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation and see the
  `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the
  `ConnectionErrorCode`, see `CustomKeyStoresListEntry`.

  To fix the failure, use the `DisconnectCustomKeyStore` operation to
  disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the
  `UpdateCustomKeyStore` operation if necessary, and then use
  `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.

  If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store,
  see [Troubleshooting a Custom Key
  Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html)

  Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK).
  You can use an alias to identify a CMK in [cryptographic
  operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations),
  such as `Encrypt` and `GenerateDataKey`. You can change the CMK associated
  with the alias at any time.

  Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify
  your applications. For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can
  change the CMK your code uses by associating a given alias with a different
  CMK.

  To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code,
  such as `alias/ApplicationKey`. Then, in each AWS Region, create an
  `alias/ApplicationKey` alias that is associated with a CMK in that Region.
  When you run your code, it uses the `alias/ApplicationKey` CMK for that AWS
  Region without any Region-specific code.

  This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you
  created, use the `ListAliases` operation.

  To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information.

  <ul> <li> Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single
  CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in
  the same AWS account and Region.

  </li> <li> You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the
  same AWS account and Region. However, you do not have permission to
  associate an alias with an [AWS managed
  CMK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk)
  or an [AWS owned
  CMK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk).

  </li> <li> To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the
  `UpdateAlias` operation. The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same
  type (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key
  usage (`ENCRYPT_DECRYPT` or `SIGN_VERIFY`). This restriction prevents
  cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.

  </li> <li> The alias name must begin with `alias/` followed by a name, such
  as `alias/ExampleAlias`. It can contain only alphanumeric characters,
  forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot
  begin with `alias/aws/`. The `alias/aws/` prefix is reserved for [AWS
  managed
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk).

  </li> <li> The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you
  can use the same alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account.
  Each instance of the alias is associated with a CMK in its Region.

  </li> <li> After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name.
  However, you can use the `DeleteAlias` operation to delete the alias and
  then create a new alias with the desired name.

  </li> <li> You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS
  KMS [cryptographic
  operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations)
  and in the `DescribeKey` operation. However, you cannot use alias names or
  alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as `DisableKey` or
  `GetKeyPolicy`. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each
  AWS KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the `KeyId` parameter in the
  API operation documentation.

  </li> </ul> Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and
  change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not
  appear in the response from the `DescribeKey` operation. To get the aliases
  and alias ARNs of CMKs in each AWS account and Region, use the
  `ListAliases` operation.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  Adds a grant to a customer master key (CMK). The grant allows the grantee
  principal to use the CMK when the conditions specified in the grant are
  met. When setting permissions, grants are an alternative to key policies.

  To create a grant that allows a [cryptographic

  use the `Constraints` parameter. For details, see `GrantConstraints`.

  You can create grants on symmetric and asymmetric CMKs. However, if the
  grant allows an operation that the CMK does not support, `CreateGrant`
  fails with a `ValidationException`.

  <ul> <li> Grants for symmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not
  supported for symmetric CMKs, including `Sign`, `Verify`, and
  `GetPublicKey`. (There are limited exceptions to this rule for legacy
  operations, but you should not create a grant for an operation that AWS KMS
  does not support.)

  </li> <li> Grants for asymmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not
  supported for asymmetric CMKs, including operations that [generate data

  for asymmetric CMKs with a `KeyUsage` of `SIGN_VERIFY` cannot allow the
  `Encrypt` or `Decrypt` operations.

  create a CMK in a different AWS account.

  You can use the `CreateKey` operation to create symmetric or asymmetric
  CMKs.

  <ul> <li> **Symmetric CMKs** contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never
  leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can
  use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they
  are typically used to generate [data
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys)
  and [data keys
  pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-key-pairs).
  For details, see `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair`.

  </li> <li> **Asymmetric CMKs** can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic
  Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS
  KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the `GetPublicKey` operation to
  download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA
  key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify
  messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign

  </li> </ul> For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see [Using
  Symmetric and Asymmetric
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:

  <dl> <dt>Asymmetric CMKs</dt> <dd> To create an asymmetric CMK, use the
  `CustomerMasterKeySpec` parameter to specify the type of key material in
  the CMK. Then, use the `KeyUsage` parameter to determine whether the CMK
  will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change
  these properties after the CMK is created.

  </dd> <dt>Symmetric CMKs</dt> <dd> When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't
  need to specify the `CustomerMasterKeySpec` or `KeyUsage` parameters. The
  default value for `CustomerMasterKeySpec`, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and the
  default value for `KeyUsage`, `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, are the only valid values
  for symmetric CMKs.

  </dd> <dt>Imported Key Material</dt> <dd> To import your own key material,
  begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the
  `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL`. Next, use
  `GetParametersForImport` operation to get a public key and import token,
  and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use
  `ImportKeyMaterial` with your import token to import the key material. For
  step-by-step instructions, see [Importing Key
  Material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html)
  in the * *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide* *. You cannot import
  the key material into an asymmetric CMK.

  </dd> <dt>Custom Key Stores</dt> <dd> To create a symmetric CMK in a
  [custom key
  store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html),
  use the `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to specify the custom key store. You
  must also use the `Origin` parameter with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The
  AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have
  at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.

  You cannot create an asymmetric CMK in a custom key store. For information
  about custom key stores in AWS KMS see [Using Custom Key

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKeyPair`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`

  </li> <li> `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`

  </li> </ul> You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was

  CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside
  of AWS KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it
  cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the [AWS
  Encryption
  SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/) or
  [Amazon S3 client-side
  encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).
  These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS
  KMS.

  If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, you do not need to
  specify the CMK or the encryption algorithm. AWS KMS can get this
  information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob.
  However, if you prefer, you can specify the `KeyId` to ensure that a
  particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a
  different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the `Decrypt`
  operation fails.

  Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the
  Decrypt operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies.
  Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt
  permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was
  encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account
  CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for `Decrypt` permissions,
  limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  This detailed information includes the key ARN, creation date (and deletion

  information about the custom key store, such as the key store ID and the

  distinguish symmetric from asymmetric CMKs. It also provides information
  that is particularly important to asymmetric CMKs, such as the key usage
  (encryption or signing) and the encryption algorithms or signing algorithms
  that the CMK supports.

  `DescribeKey` does not return the following information:

  <ul> <li> Aliases associated with the CMK. To get this information, use
  `ListAliases`.

  </li> <li> Whether automatic key rotation is enabled on the CMK. To get

  Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK).
  The `Encrypt` operation has two primary use cases:

  <ul> <li> You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a
  personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.

  </li> <li> You can use the `Encrypt` operation to move encrypted data from
  one AWS Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key
  and use the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the
  `Encrypt` operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region
  B. Now, you can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to
  Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the
  encrypted data entirely within in Region B.

  </li> </ul> You don't need to use the `Encrypt` operation to encrypt a data
  key. The `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair` operations return a
  plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.

  When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to
  use in the encryption operation. The CMK must have a `KeyUsage` value of
  `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.` To find the `KeyUsage` of a CMK, use the `DescribeKey`
  operation.

  If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add
  additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an
  `EncryptionContext` when encrypting data, you must specify the same
  encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data.
  Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an
  `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more information, see [Encryption
  Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption
  algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.

  <important> When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be
  sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will
  be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to
  encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  </important> The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with
  the type of CMK and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

  **How to use your data key**

  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in
  your application. You can write your own code or use a client-side
  encryption library, such as the [AWS Encryption
  SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/),
  the [Amazon DynamoDB Encryption

  or [Amazon S3 client-side
  encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html)
  to do these tasks for you.

  To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

  <ol> <li> Use the `GenerateDataKey` operation to get a data key.

  </li> <li> Use the plaintext data key (in the `Plaintext` field of the
  response) to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext
  data key from memory.

  </li> <li> Store the encrypted data key (in the `CiphertextBlob` field of
  the response) with the encrypted data.

  </li> </ol> To decrypt data outside of AWS KMS:

  <ol> <li> Use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted data key.
  The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.

  </li> <li> Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of AWS KMS,
  then erase the plaintext data key from memory.

  outside of AWS KMS.

  `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns a unique data key pair for each request. The

  You can use the public key that `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns to encrypt

  message, you can use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted
  private key.

  key (CMK) to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an
  asymmetric CMK or a CMK in a custom key store. To get the type and origin
  of your CMK, use the `DescribeKey` operation.

  If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation

  `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext` is identical to the `GenerateDataKey`

  (CMK) that was created without key material. After you successfully import
  key material into a CMK, you can [reimport the same key
  material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html#reimport-key-material)
  into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material.

  You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric CMK or on any CMK in a
  different AWS account. For more information about creating CMKs with no key
  material and then importing key material, see [Importing Key
  Material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Before using this operation, call `GetParametersForImport`. Its response
  includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt
  the key material. Then, submit the import token from the same
  `GetParametersForImport` response.

  When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

  <ul> <li> The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its `Origin`
  must be `EXTERNAL`.

  To create a CMK with no key material, call `CreateKey` and set the value of
  its `Origin` parameter to `EXTERNAL`. To get the `Origin` of a CMK, call
  `DescribeKey`.)

  </li> <li> The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the
  key material, call `GetParametersForImport`.

  </li> <li> The import token that `GetParametersForImport` returned. You
  must use a public key and token from the same `GetParametersForImport`
  response.

  </li> <li> Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an
  expiration date, AWS KMS deletes the key material from the CMK on the
  specified date, and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you
  must reimport the same key material. The only way to change an expiration
  date is by reimporting the same key material and specifying a new
  expiration date.

  </li> </ul> When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK
  changes from `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the CMK.

  If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem.
  If the error is related to the key material, the import token, or wrapping
  key, use `GetParametersForImport` to get a new public key and import token
  for the CMK and repeat the import procedure. For help, see [How To Import

  Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS. You can

  reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the [encryption
  context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  of a ciphertext.

  The `ReEncrypt` operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
  using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as `Encrypt` or
  `GenerateDataKey`. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
  using the public key of an [asymmetric
  CMK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks)
  outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other
  libraries, such as the [AWS Encryption
  SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/) or
  [Amazon S3 client-side
  encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).
  These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS
  KMS.

  When you use the `ReEncrypt` operation, you need to provide information for
  the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.

  <ul> <li> If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you
  must identify the *source CMK*, that is, the CMK that encrypted the
  ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used.
  This information is required to decrypt the data.

  </li> <li> It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the
  ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the
  ciphertext is decrypted only by using a particular CMK. If the CMK that you
  specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the `ReEncrypt` operation fails.

  </li> <li> To reencrypt the data, you must specify the *destination CMK*,
  that is, the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can
  select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an
  asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The
  algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.

  <important> When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be
  sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will
  be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to
  encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  </important> </li> </ul> Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, `ReEncrypt`
  callers must have two permissions:

  <ul> <li> `kms:ReEncryptFrom` permission on the source CMK

  </li> <li> `kms:ReEncryptTo` permission on the destination CMK

  </li> </ul> To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the
  `"kms:ReEncrypt*"` permission in your [key
  policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html).
  This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use
  the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you
  create a CMK programmatically or when you use the `PutKeyPolicy` operation
  to set a key policy.

  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). You may provide a

  `PendingDeletion`. Before the waiting period ends, you can use
  `CancelKeyDeletion` to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting
  period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with
  it, including all aliases that refer to it.

  <important> Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous
  operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK

  `DisableKey`.

  </important> If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a [custom key

  Creates a [digital
  signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) for a message
  or message digest by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. To verify

  asymmetric CMKs, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
  CMKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair,
  such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer
  master key (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private
  key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the
  message was signed with that particular private key and that the message
  hasn't changed since it was signed.

  To use the `Sign` operation, provide the following information:

  <ul> <li> Use the `KeyId` parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a
  `KeyUsage` value of `SIGN_VERIFY`. To get the `KeyUsage` value of a CMK,
  use the `DescribeKey` operation. The caller must have `kms:Sign` permission
  on the CMK.

  </li> <li> Use the `Message` parameter to specify the message or message
  digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a
  larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the
  hash digest in the `Message` parameter. To indicate whether the message is
  a full message or a digest, use the `MessageType` parameter.

  </li> <li> Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.
