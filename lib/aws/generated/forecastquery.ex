  Retrieves a forecast for a single item, filtered by the supplied criteria.

  The criteria is a key-value pair. The key is either `item_id` (or the equivalent
  non-timestamp, non-target field) from the `TARGET_TIME_SERIES` dataset, or one
  of the forecast dimensions specified as part of the `FeaturizationConfig`
  object.

  By default, `QueryForecast` returns the complete date range for the filtered
  forecast. You can request a specific date range.

  To get the full forecast, use the
  [CreateForecastExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateForecastExportJob.html)
  operation.

  The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same timezone as the
  dataset that was used to create the predictor.
