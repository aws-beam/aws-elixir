  This action aborts a multipart upload.

  After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using
  that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be
  freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part
  uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort
  a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage
  consumed by all parts.

  To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the
  part storage, you should call the
  [ListParts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListParts.html) action and ensure that the parts list is empty.

  Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts.

  You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the
  [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you
  call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3
  concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new
  object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts
  list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates
  the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must
  provide the part number and the `ETag` value, returned after that part was
  uploaded.

  Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to
  complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP
  response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in
  progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the
  connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200
  OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to
  determine whether the request succeeded.

  Note that if `CompleteMultipartUpload` fails, applications should be prepared to
  retry the failed requests. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Error Best
  Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ErrorBestPractices.html).

  Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.

  You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy
  of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API.
  However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload
  Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see [Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload
  API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjctsUsingRESTMPUapi.html).

  All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have *read*
  access to the source object and *write* access to the destination bucket. For
  more information, see [REST Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html).
  Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you
  want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.

  A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or
  while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action
  starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the
  copy operation, the error response is embedded in the `200 OK` response. This
  means that a `200 OK` response can contain either a success or an error. Design
  your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it
  appropriately.

  If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the
  copied object.

  If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were
  not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the
  entire body.

  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you
  specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see [Amazon S3 pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/).

  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you
  request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a
  400 `Bad Request` error. For more information, see [Transfer Acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html).

  ## Metadata

  When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new
  metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user
  making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when
  generating a copy request. For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html).

  To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or
  replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the
  `x-amz-metadata-directive` header. When you grant permissions, you can use the
  `s3:x-amz-metadata-directive` condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior
  when objects are uploaded. For more information, see [Specifying Conditions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/amazon-s3-policy-keys.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific
  condition keys, see [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/list_amazons3.html).

  ##  `x-amz-copy-source-if` Headers

  To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the `Etag`
  matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use
  the following request parameters:

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`

  If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` and
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request and
  evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data:

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to true

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to
  false

  If both the `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` headers are present in the request and
  evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the `412 Precondition Failed` response
  code:

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to false

    * `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to true

  All headers with the `x-amz-` prefix, including `x-amz-copy-source`, must be
  signed.

  ## Server-side encryption

  When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate
  encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption
  with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided
  encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it
  writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it.
  For more information about server-side encryption, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html).

  If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object.
  For more information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html) in the
  *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

  When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based
  permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access
  control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS
  accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are
  then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
  Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) and
  [Managing ACLs Using the REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html).

  ## Storage Class Options

  You can use the `CopyObject` action to change the storage class of an object
  that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the `StorageClass` parameter. For more
  information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Versioning

  By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of an object to
  copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the
  object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the `versionId`
  subresource.

  If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique
  version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the
  version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied
  object in the `x-amz-version-id` response header in the response.

  If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version
  ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.

  If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this
  object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more
  information, see
  [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html).  The following operations are related to `CopyObject`:

    *
  [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)

    *
  [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html) 

  For more information, see [Copying
  Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/CopyingObjectsExamples.html).

  Creates a new S3 bucket.

  To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access
  Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create
  buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.

  Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket
  naming restrictions, see [Bucket naming rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).

  If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see [Create Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html).

  By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can
  optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to
  optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For
  example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to
  create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see
  [Accessing a bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro).

  If you send your create bucket request to the `s3.amazonaws.com` endpoint, the
  request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in
  Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location
  constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be
  created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia),
  your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see
  [Virtual hosting of buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html).

  When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the
  accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket.
  There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request
  headers.

    * Specify a canned ACL using the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon
  S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL
  has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see
  [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

    * Specify access permissions explicitly using the
  `x-amz-grant-read`, `x-amz-grant-write`, `x-amz-grant-read-acp`,
  `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control` headers. These headers
  map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
  information, see [Access control list (ACL) overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the
  following:

      * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
  of an AWS account

      * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a
  predefined group

      * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email
  address of an AWS account

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

     Europe (Ireland)

     South America (São Paulo)

  For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and
  Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
  in the AWS General Reference.

  For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the AWS accounts
  identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

  `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `

  You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You
  cannot do both.

  This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID.

  This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart
  upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part
  requests (see
  [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html)). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort
  the multipart upload request.

  For more information about multipart uploads, see [Multipart Upload
  Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html).

  If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads,
  the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket
  lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes
  eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more
  information, see [Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html#mpu-abort-incomplete-mpu-lifecycle-config).

  For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API,
  see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html).

  For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You
  initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then
  complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There
  is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information
  about signing, see [Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html).

  After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop
  being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort
  the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and
  stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a
  multipart upload.

  You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption,
  Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
  decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use
  AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon
  S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key,
  the request headers you provide in
  [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) and
  [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html)
  requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload
  by using `CreateMultipartUpload`.

  To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the
  requester must have permission to the `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:GenerateDataKey*`
  actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must
  decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the
  multipart upload. For more information, see [Multipart upload API and permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/mpuoverview.html#mpuAndPermissions)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS
  account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key
  policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key,
  then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or
  role.

  For more information, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html).

  ## Definitions

  ### Access Permissions

  When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that
  should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to
  grant the permissions using the request headers:

     Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. For more
  information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

     Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
  `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control`
  headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports
  in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

  You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You
  cannot do both.

  ### Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers

  You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side
  encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3
  encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it
  when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS
  managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.

     Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys
  (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to
  manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the
  request.

       x-amz-server-side-encryption

       x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id

       x-amz-server-side-encryption-context

  If you specify `x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms`, but don't provide
  `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed
  CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.

  All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't
  make them with SSL or by using SigV4.

  For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
  (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
  KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).

     Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your
  own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.

       x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

       x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

       x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

  For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS
  (SSE-KMS), see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS
  KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html).

  ### Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

  You also can use the following access control–related headers with this
  operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access
  control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS
  accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are
  then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information,
  see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html).
  With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following
  two methods:

     Specify a canned ACL (`x-amz-acl`) — Amazon S3 supports a set of
  predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of
  grantees and permissions. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

     Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access
  permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each
  header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more
  information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html). In
  the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To
  grant permissions explicitly, use:

       x-amz-grant-read

       x-amz-grant-write

       x-amz-grant-read-acp

       x-amz-grant-write-acp

       x-amz-grant-full-control

  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the
  following:

       `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
  of an AWS account

       `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a predefined
  group

       `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email
  address of an AWS account

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

     Europe (Ireland)

     South America (São Paulo)

  For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and
  Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
  in the AWS General Reference.

  For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants the AWS accounts
  identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:

  `x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666" `

  Removes the null version (if there is one) of an object and inserts a delete
  marker, which becomes the latest version of the object.

  If there isn't a null version, Amazon S3 does not remove any objects but will
  still respond that the command was successful.

  To remove a specific version, you must be the bucket owner and you must use the
  version Id subresource. Using this subresource permanently deletes the version.
  If the object deleted is a delete marker, Amazon S3 sets the response header,
  `x-amz-delete-marker`, to true.

  If the object you want to delete is in a bucket where the bucket versioning
  configuration is MFA Delete enabled, you must include the `x-amz-mfa` request
  header in the DELETE `versionId` request. Requests that include `x-amz-mfa` must
  use HTTPS.

  This action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single
  HTTP request.

  If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a
  suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request
  overhead.

  The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the
  XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want
  to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For
  each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that
  delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified
  in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.

  The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default,
  the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of
  deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only
  keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion,
  the action does not return any information about the delete in the response
  body.

  When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to
  delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not
  provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned
  objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there
  are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request
  will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see [ MFA Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete).

  Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete
  requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has
  not been altered in transit.

  Gets the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs
  by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier,
  without additional operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers
  automatic cost savings by moving data between access tiers, when access patterns
  change.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger than 128
  KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of an object is less
  than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored,
  but they are always charged at the frequent access tier rates in the S3
  Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

  If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage duration
  period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed

  Retrieves objects from Amazon S3.

  To use `GET`, you must have `READ` access to the object. If you grant `READ`
  access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an
  authorization header.

  An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a
  typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by
  using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of
  naming an object `sample.jpg`, you can name it
  `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`.

  To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for
  the object in the `GET` operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example,
  if you have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`, specify the resource
  as `/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For a path-style request example, if you
  have the object `photos/2006/February/sample.jpg` in the bucket named
  `examplebucket`, specify the resource as
  `/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg`. For more information about
  request types, see [HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html#VirtualHostingSpecifyBucket).

  To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using
  BitTorrent. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Torrent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3Torrent.html). For
  more information about returning the ACL of an object, see
  [GetObjectAcl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectAcl.html).  If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep
  Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3
  Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you
  must first restore a copy using
  [RestoreObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_RestoreObject.html).
  Otherwise, this action returns an `InvalidObjectStateError` error. For
  information about restoring archived objects, see [Restoring Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html).

  Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`, should not be
  sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs
  stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed
  encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll
  get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided
  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you
  GET the object, you must use the following headers:

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

  For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption
  Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html).

  Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the
  `s3:GetObjectVersionTagging` action), the response also returns the
  `x-amz-tagging-count` header that provides the count of number of tags
  associated with the object. You can use
  [GetObjectTagging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObjectTagging.html) to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.

  ## Permissions

  You need the `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation. For more information,
  see [Specifying Permissions in a
  Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).
  If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on
  whether you also have the `s3:ListBucket` permission.

    * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon
  S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.

    * If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3 will
  return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.

  ## Versioning

  By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a
  different version, use the `versionId` subresource.

  If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if
  the object was deleted and includes `x-amz-delete-marker: true` in the response.

  For more information about versioning, see
  [PutBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html).  ## Overriding Response Header Values

  There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a
  GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response
  header value in your GET request.

  You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query
  parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request,
  that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can
  override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3
  accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override
  for the GET response are `Content-Type`, `Content-Language`, `Expires`,
  `Cache-Control`, `Content-Disposition`, and `Content-Encoding`. To override
  these header values in the GET response, you use the following request
  parameters.

  You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned
  URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned
  (anonymous) request.

    * `response-content-type`

    * `response-content-language`

    * `response-expires`

    * `response-cache-control`

    * `response-content-disposition`

    * `response-content-encoding`

  ## Additional Considerations about Request Headers

  If both of the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the
  request as follows: `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;
  `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`; then, S3 returns 200 OK
  and the data requested.

  If both of the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in
  the request as follows:` If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;
  `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`; then, S3 returns 304 Not
  Modified response code.

  7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

  The HEAD action retrieves metadata from an object without returning the object
  itself.

  This action is useful if you're only interested in an object's metadata. To use
  HEAD, you must have READ access to the object.

  A `HEAD` request has the same options as a `GET` action on an object. The
  response is identical to the `GET` response except that there is no response
  body. Because of this, if the `HEAD` request generates an error, it returns a
  generic `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden` code. It is not possible to retrieve
  the exact exception beyond these error codes.

  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided
  encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you
  retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

  For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption
  Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html).

     Encryption request headers, like `x-amz-server-side-encryption`,
  should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption
  with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon
  S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of
  keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.

     The last modified property in this case is the creation date of the
  object.

  Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see [Common Request
  Headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTCommonRequestHeaders.html).

  Consider the following when using request headers:

    * Consideration 1 – If both of the `If-Match` and
  `If-Unmodified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:

      * `If-Match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;

      * `If-Unmodified-Since` condition evaluates to `false`;

  Then Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and the data requested.

    * Consideration 2 – If both of the `If-None-Match` and
  `If-Modified-Since` headers are present in the request as follows:

      * `If-None-Match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;

      * `If-Modified-Since` condition evaluates to `true`;

  Then Amazon S3 returns the `304 Not Modified` response code.

  For more information about conditional requests, see [RFC 7232](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232).

  ## Permissions

  You need the `s3:GetObject` permission for this operation. For more information,
  see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html).
  If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on
  whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.

    * If you have the `s3:ListBucket` permission on the bucket, Amazon
  S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.

    * If you don’t have the `s3:ListBucket` permission, Amazon S3
  returns an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.

  Lists the S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration from the specified bucket.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs
  by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier,
  without additional operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers
  automatic cost savings by moving data between access tiers, when access patterns
  change.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger than 128
  KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of an object is less
  than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored,
  but they are always charged at the frequent access tier rates in the S3
  Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

  If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage duration
  period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed
  objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

  This action lists in-progress multipart uploads.

  An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated
  using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or
  aborted.

  This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000
  multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which
  is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a
  response by specifying the `max-uploads` parameter in the response. If
  additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria, the response will
  contain an `IsTruncated` element with the value true. To list the additional
  multipart uploads, use the `key-marker` and `upload-id-marker` request
  parameters.

  In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has
  initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads
  in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in
  ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time.

  Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload.

  This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the
  initiate multipart upload request (see
  [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html)). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of
  parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by
  specifying the `max-parts` request parameter. If your multipart upload consists
  of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an `IsTruncated` field with the
  value of true, and a `NextPartNumberMarker` element. In subsequent `ListParts`
  requests you can include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set
  its value to the `NextPartNumberMarker` field value from the previous response.

  Sets the accelerate configuration of an existing bucket.

  Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables you to
  perform faster data transfers to Amazon S3.

  To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the
  s3:PutAccelerateConfiguration action. The bucket owner has this permission by
  default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more
  information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)
  and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

  The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following
  two values:

    * Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

    * Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.

  The
  [GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html) action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.

  After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might
  take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.

  The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and
  must not contain periods (".").

  Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL).

  For more information, see [Using ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html).
  To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have `WRITE_ACP` permission.

  You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:

    * Specify the ACL in the request body

    * Specify permissions using request headers

  You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request
  headers.

  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket
  using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an
  existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you
  can continue to use that approach.

  ## Access Permissions

  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

    * Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon
  S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as *canned ACLs*. Each canned ACL
  has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as
  the value of `x-amz-acl`. If you use this header, you cannot use other access
  control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
  `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control`
  headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and
  grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If
  you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the `x-amz-acl` header to set
  a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3
  supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the
  following:

      * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
  of an AWS account

      * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a
  predefined group

      * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email
  address of an AWS account

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

     Europe (Ireland)

     South America (São Paulo)

  For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and
  Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
  in the AWS General Reference.

  For example, the following `x-amz-grant-write` header grants create, overwrite,
  and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and
  two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.

  `x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery",
  id="111122223333", id="555566667777" `

  You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You
  cannot do both.

  ## Grantee Values

  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights
  (using request elements) in the following ways:

    * By the person's ID:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
  </Grantee>`

  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request

    * By URI:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`

    * By Email address:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`

  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object
  acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

     Europe (Ireland)

     South America (São Paulo)

  Sets the `cors` configuration for your bucket.

  If the configuration exists, Amazon S3 replaces it.

  To use this operation, you must be allowed to perform the `s3:PutBucketCORS`
  action. By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to
  others.

  You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service
  cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose
  origin is `http://www.example.com` to access your Amazon S3 bucket at
  `my.example.bucket.com` by using the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` capability.

  To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the `cors`
  subresource to the bucket. The `cors` subresource is an XML document in which
  you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be
  executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.

  When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request)
  against a bucket, it evaluates the `cors` configuration on the bucket and uses
  the first `CORSRule` rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a
  cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:

    * The request's `Origin` header must match `AllowedOrigin` elements.

    * The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the
  `Access-Control-Request-Method` header in case of a pre-flight `OPTIONS` request
  must be one of the `AllowedMethod` elements.

    * Every header specified in the `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
  request header of a pre-flight request must match an `AllowedHeader` element.

  Puts a S3 Intelligent-Tiering configuration to the specified bucket.

  You can have up to 1,000 S3 Intelligent-Tiering configurations per bucket.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize storage costs
  by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier,
  without additional operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers
  automatic cost savings by moving data between access tiers, when access patterns
  change.

  The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is suitable for objects larger than 128
  KB that you plan to store for at least 30 days. If the size of an object is less
  than 128 KB, it is not eligible for auto-tiering. Smaller objects can be stored,
  but they are always charged at the frequent access tier rates in the S3
  Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

  If you delete an object before the end of the 30-day minimum storage duration
  period, you are charged for 30 days. For more information, see [Storage class for automatically optimizing frequently and infrequently accessed
  objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html#sc-dynamic-data-access).

  This implementation of the `PUT` action adds an inventory configuration
  (identified by the inventory ID) to the bucket.

  You can have up to 1,000 inventory configurations per bucket.

  Amazon S3 inventory generates inventories of the objects in the bucket on a
  daily or weekly basis, and the results are published to a flat file. The bucket
  that is inventoried is called the *source* bucket, and the bucket where the
  inventory flat file is stored is called the *destination* bucket. The
  *destination* bucket must be in the same AWS Region as the *source* bucket.

  When you configure an inventory for a *source* bucket, you specify the
  *destination* bucket where you want the inventory to be stored, and whether to
  generate the inventory daily or weekly. You can also configure what object
  metadata to include and whether to inventory all object versions or only current
  versions. For more information, see [Amazon S3 Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html)
  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

  You must create a bucket policy on the *destination* bucket to grant permissions
  to Amazon S3 to write objects to the bucket in the defined location. For an
  example policy, see [ Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and Storage Class
  Analysis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9).

  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
  `s3:PutInventoryConfiguration` action. The bucket owner has this permission by
  default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about
  permissions, see [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)

  Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the bucket or replaces an existing

  For information about lifecycle configuration, see [Managing your storage lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html).

  Bucket lifecycle configuration now supports specifying a lifecycle rule using an
  object key name prefix, one or more object tags, or a combination of both.
  Accordingly, this section describes the latest API. The previous version of the
  API supported filtering based only on an object key name prefix, which is
  supported for backward compatibility. For the related API description, see
  [PutBucketLifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycle.html). 
  ## Rules

  You specify the lifecycle configuration in your request body. The lifecycle
  configuration is specified as XML consisting of one or more rules. Each rule
  consists of the following:

    * Filter identifying a subset of objects to which the rule applies.
  The filter can be based on a key name prefix, object tags, or a combination of
  both.

    * Status whether the rule is in effect.

    * One or more lifecycle transition and expiration actions that you
  want Amazon S3 to perform on the objects identified by the filter. If the state
  of your bucket is versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended, you can have many
  versions of the same object (one current version and zero or more noncurrent
  versions). Amazon S3 provides predefined actions that you can specify for
  current and noncurrent object versions.

  ## Permissions

  By default, all Amazon S3 resources are private, including buckets, objects, and
  related subresources (for example, lifecycle configuration and website
  configuration). Only the resource owner (that is, the AWS account that created
  it) can access the resource. The resource owner can optionally grant access
  permissions to others by writing an access policy. For this operation, a user

  Set the logging parameters for a bucket and to specify permissions for who can
  view and modify the logging parameters.

  All logs are saved to buckets in the same AWS Region as the source bucket. To
  set the logging status of a bucket, you must be the bucket owner.

  The bucket owner is automatically granted FULL_CONTROL to all logs. You use the
  `Grantee` request element to grant access to other people. The `Permissions`
  request element specifies the kind of access the grantee has to the logs.

  ## Grantee Values

  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights
  (using request elements) in the following ways:

    * By the person's ID:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
  </Grantee>`

  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.

    * By Email address:

  ` <Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress></Grantee>`

  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object
  acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

    * By URI:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`

  To enable logging, you use LoggingEnabled and its children request elements. To
  disable logging, you use an empty BucketLoggingStatus request element:

  `<BucketLoggingStatus xmlns="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01" />`

  Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket.

  For more information about event notifications, see [Configuring Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

  Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The
  configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon
  S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event
  notification when it detects an event of the specified type.

  By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the
  notification configuration will be an empty `NotificationConfiguration`.

  `<NotificationConfiguration>`

  `</NotificationConfiguration>`

  This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the
  configuration you include in the request body.

  After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple
  Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
  destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by
  sending a test notification. In the case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3
  verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to
  invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see
  [Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html).

  You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration
  element.

  By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket.
  However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other
  users to set this configuration with `s3:PutBucketNotification` permission.

  The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your
  notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function
  configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3
  sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT
  action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.

  ## Responses

  If the configuration in the request body includes only one `TopicConfiguration`
  specifying only the `s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject` event type, the response
  will also include the `x-amz-sns-test-message-id` header containing the message
  ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

  [iam:PassRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html)
  permission.

  Specify the replication configuration in the request body. In the replication
  configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where
  you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume
  to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information.

  A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a
  maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by
  filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of
  objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

  To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication
  rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter
  objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When
  you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following
  elements: `DeleteMarkerReplication`, `Status`, and `Priority`.

  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3
  handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see
  [Backward Compatibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-add-config.html#replication-backward-compat-considerations).

  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see [Using Versioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html).

  By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the
  bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others
  permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions,
  see [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-with-s3-actions.html)
  and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html).

  ## Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects

  By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using
  server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS. To replicate AWS
  KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: `SourceSelectionCriteria`,
  `SseKmsEncryptedObjects`, `Status`, `EncryptionConfiguration`, and
  `ReplicaKmsKeyID`. For information about replication configuration, see
  [Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using CMKs stored in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication-config-for-kms-objects.html).

  For information on `PutBucketReplication` errors, see [List of replication-related error

  Sets the versioning state of an existing bucket.

  To set the versioning state, you must be the bucket owner.

  You can set the versioning state with one of the following values:

  **Enabled**—Enables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added
  to the bucket receive a unique version ID.

  **Suspended**—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects
  added to the bucket receive the version ID null.

  If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning
  state; a
  [GetBucketVersioning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html) request does not return a versioning state value.

  If the bucket owner enables MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration,
  the bucket owner must include the `x-amz-mfa request` header and the `Status`
  and the `MfaDelete` request elements in a request to set the versioning state of
  the bucket.

  If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket
  and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable
  versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy. The noncurrent
  expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object
  versions in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one

  Sets the configuration of the website that is specified in the `website`

  To configure a bucket as a website, you can add this subresource on the bucket
  with website configuration information such as the file name of the index
  document and any redirect rules. For more information, see [Hosting Websites on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html).

  This PUT action requires the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission. By default, only
  the bucket owner can configure the website attached to a bucket; however, bucket
  owners can allow other users to set the website configuration by writing a
  bucket policy that grants them the `S3:PutBucketWebsite` permission.

  To redirect all website requests sent to the bucket's website endpoint, you add
  a website configuration with the following elements. Because all requests are
  sent to another website, you don't need to provide index document name for the
  bucket.

    * `WebsiteConfiguration`

    * `RedirectAllRequestsTo`

    * `HostName`

    * `Protocol`

  If you want granular control over redirects, you can use the following elements
  to add routing rules that describe conditions for redirecting requests and
  information about the redirect destination. In this case, the website
  configuration must provide an index document for the bucket, because some
  requests might not be redirected.

    * `WebsiteConfiguration`

  Adds an object to a bucket.

  You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.

  Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon
  S3 added the entire object to the bucket.

  Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for
  the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written.
  Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build
  it into your application layer or use versioning instead.

  To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the
  `Content-MD5` header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object
  against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error.
  Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and
  compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.

  The `Content-MD5` header is required for any request to upload an object with a
  retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information
  about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see [Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Server-side Encryption

  You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption,
  Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and
  decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own
  encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more
  information, see [Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).

  If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service
  (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more
  information, see [Amazon S3 Bucket Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/bucket-key.html) in the
  *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers

  You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are
  private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you
  can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined
  by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For
  more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) and
  [Managing ACLs Using the REST API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-using-rest-api.html).

  ## Storage Class Options

  By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created
  objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high
  availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different
  Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For
  more information, see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Versioning

  If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a
  unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the
  response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives
  multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the
  objects.

  For more information about versioning, see [Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/AddingObjectstoVersioningEnabledBuckets.html).

  Uses the `acl` subresource to set the access control list (ACL) permissions for
  a new or existing object in an S3 bucket.

  You must have `WRITE_ACP` permission to set the ACL of an object. For more
  information, see [What permissions can I grant?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#permissions)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

  Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object
  using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an
  existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can
  continue to use that approach. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL)
  Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html) in
  the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Access Permissions

  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:

    * Specify a canned ACL with the `x-amz-acl` request header. Amazon
  S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has
  a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the
  value of `x-amz-ac`l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access
  control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL).

    * Specify access permissions explicitly with the `x-amz-grant-read`,
  `x-amz-grant-read-acp`, `x-amz-grant-write-acp`, and `x-amz-grant-full-control`
  headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and
  grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If
  you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use `x-amz-acl` header to set a
  canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3
  supports in an ACL. For more information, see [Access Control List (ACL) Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html).

  You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the
  following:

      * `id` – if the value specified is the canonical user ID
  of an AWS account

      * `uri` – if you are granting permissions to a
  predefined group

      * `emailAddress` – if the value specified is the email
  address of an AWS account

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

     Europe (Ireland)

     South America (São Paulo)

  For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see [Regions and
  Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region)
  in the AWS General Reference.

  For example, the following `x-amz-grant-read` header grants list objects
  permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.

  `x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"
  `

  You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You
  cannot do both.

  ## Grantee Values

  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights
  (using request elements) in the following ways:

    * By the person's ID:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="CanonicalUser"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName>
  </Grantee>`

  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.

    * By URI:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="Group"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>`

    * By Email address:

  `<Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee>`

  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object
  acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following
  AWS Regions:

     US East (N. Virginia)

     US West (N. California)

     US West (Oregon)

     Asia Pacific (Singapore)

     Asia Pacific (Sydney)

     Asia Pacific (Tokyo)

  ## Versioning

  The ACL of an object is set at the object version level. By default, PUT sets
  the ACL of the current version of an object. To set the ACL of a different
  version, use the `versionId` subresource.

  Restores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3

  This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.

  This action performs the following types of requests:

    * `select` - Perform a select query on an archived object

    * `restore an archive` - Restore an archived object

  To use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the
  `s3:RestoreObject` action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and
  can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see
  [Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)
  and [Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Querying Archives with Select Requests

  You use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The
  archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted
  as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and
  custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a
  hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see [Querying Archived
  Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  When making a select request, do the following:

    * Define an output location for the select query's output. This must
  be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the
  archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job
  must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage
  class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more
  information about output, see [Querying Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/querying-glacier-archives.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  For more information about the `S3` structure in the request body, see the
  following:

      *
  [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)       * [Managing Access with
  ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html) in
  the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

      * [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*

    * Define the SQL expression for the `SELECT` type of restoration for
  your query in the request body's `SelectParameters` structure. You can use
  expressions like the following examples.

      * The following expression returns all records from the
  specified object.

  `SELECT * FROM Object`

      * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data
  stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.

  `SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100`

      * If you have headers and you set the `fileHeaderInfo`
  in the `CSV` structure in the request body to `USE`, you can specify headers in
  the query. (If you set the `fileHeaderInfo` field to `IGNORE`, the first row is
  skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column
  names.

  `SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s`

  For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see [SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier
  Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-glacier-select-sql-reference.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  When making a select request, you can also do the following:

    * To expedite your queries, specify the `Expedited` tier. For more
  information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.

    * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the
  input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded
  query results.

  The following are additional important facts about the select feature:

    * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive
  retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a
  lifecycle policy.

    * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3
  object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate
  requests.

    * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already
  been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response `409`.

  ## Restoring objects

  Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage
  class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive
  tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep
  Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait
  until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3
  Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a
  restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is
  available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the
  duration (number of days) that you specify.

  To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't
  provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.

  When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify
  one of the following data access tier options in the `Tier` element of the
  request body:

    * ** `Expedited` ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly
  access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3
  Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of
  archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data
  accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5
  minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited
  retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned
  capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.

    * ** `Standard` ** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of
  your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for
  retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals
  typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage
  class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12
  hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3
  Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects
  stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

    * ** `Bulk` ** - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval
  option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of
  data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for
  objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive
  tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier
  Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk
  retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.

  For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity
  for `Expedited` data access, see [Restoring Archived Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a
  faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see [ Upgrading the speed of an in-progress
  restore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a `HEAD` request.
  Operations return the `x-amz-restore` header, which provides information about
  the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event
  notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more
  information, see [Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by
  reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration
  period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are
  no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon
  S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.

  If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an
  expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you
  specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10
  days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the
  object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see
  [PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html) and [Object Lifecycle
  Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html)
  in *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Responses

  A successful action returns either the `200 OK` or `202 Accepted` status code.

    * If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns
  `202 Accepted` in the response.

    * If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns `200 OK`
  in the response.

  ## Special Errors

    *     * *Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress*

      * *Cause: Object restore is already in progress. (This
  error does not apply to SELECT type requests.)*

      * *HTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict*

      * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client*

    *     * *Code:
  GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable*

      * *Cause: expedited retrievals are currently not
  available. Try again later. (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to
  process the Expedited request. This error applies only to Expedited retrievals
  and not to S3 Standard or Bulk retrievals.)*

      * *HTTP Status Code: 503*

      * *SOAP Fault Code Prefix: N/A*

  supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression
  for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object
  compression for Parquet objects.

    * *Server-side encryption* - Amazon S3 Select supports querying
  objects that are protected with server-side encryption.

  For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C),
  you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the
  [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html). For more information about SSE-C, see [Server-Side Encryption (Using
  Customer-Provided Encryption
  Keys)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)
  and customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS),
  server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify
  anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3
  and SSE-KMS, see [Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  ## Working with the Response Body

  Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a
  series of messages and includes a `Transfer-Encoding` header with `chunked` as
  its value in the response. For more information, see [Appendix: SelectObjectContent
  Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTSelectObjectAppendix.html)
  .

  ## GetObject Support

  The `SelectObjectContent` action does not support the following `GetObject`
  functionality. For more information, see
  [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html).    * `Range`: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3
  Select request (see [SelectObjectContentRequest -
  ScanRange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_SelectObjectContent.html#AmazonS3-SelectObjectContent-request-ScanRange)
  in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object
  to return.

    * GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You
  cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or `REDUCED_REDUNDANCY` storage
  classes. For more information, about storage classes see [Storage Classes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#storage-class-intro)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

  In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an
  option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part
  you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the
  [UploadPartCopy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPartCopy.html) operation.

  You must initiate a multipart upload (see
  [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html))
  before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3
  returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload
  part request.

  Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number
  uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being
  created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with
  a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be
  at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last
  part of your multipart upload.

  To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the
  `Content-MD5` header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data
  against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an
  error.

  If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the
  `x-amz-content-sha256` header as a checksum instead of `Content-MD5`. For more
  information see [Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version
  4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html).

  **Note:** After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you
  must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged
  for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort
  multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you
  for the parts storage.

  For more information on multipart uploads, go to [Multipart Upload Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuoverview.html) in
  the *Amazon S3 User Guide *.

  For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go
  to [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your
  data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when
  you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you
  can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own
  encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the
  headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using
  [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html). For more information, go to [Using Server-Side
  Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless
  you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the
  encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to
  specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart
  request. For more information, see
  [CreateMultipartUpload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateMultipartUpload.html).  If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key
  in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption
  information in each part upload using the following headers.

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key

    * x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5

  ## Special Errors

    *     * *Code: NoSuchUpload*

      * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.
  The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted
  or completed.*

  Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source.

  You specify the data source by adding the request header `x-amz-copy-source` in
  your request and a byte range by adding the request header
  `x-amz-copy-source-range` in your request.

  The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more
  information about multipart upload limits, go to [Quick Facts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/qfacts.html) in the
  *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the
  [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html) action and provide data in your request.

  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response
  to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID,
  that you must include in your upload part request.

  For more information about using the `UploadPartCopy` operation, see the
  following:

    * For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see [Uploading
  Objects Using Multipart
  Upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/uploadobjusingmpu.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    * For information about permissions required to use the multipart
  upload API, see [Multipart Upload and Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpuAndPermissions.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    * For information about copying objects using a single atomic action
  vs. the multipart upload, see [Operations on Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectOperations.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

    * For information about using server-side encryption with
  customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see
  [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html) and
  [UploadPart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_UploadPart.html).

  Note the following additional considerations about the request headers
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`, `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`,
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`, and
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`:

    * **Consideration 1** - If both of the `x-amz-copy-source-if-match`
  and `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` headers are present in the request
  as follows:

  `x-amz-copy-source-if-match` condition evaluates to `true`, and;

  `x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since` condition evaluates to `false`;

  Amazon S3 returns `200 OK` and copies the data.

    * **Consideration 2** - If both of the
  `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` and `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`
  headers are present in the request as follows:

  `x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match` condition evaluates to `false`, and;

  `x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since` condition evaluates to `true`;

  Amazon S3 returns `412 Precondition Failed` response code.

  ## Versioning

  If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the
  same object. By default, `x-amz-copy-source` identifies the current version of
  the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't
  specify a versionId in the `x-amz-copy-source`, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error,
  because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the
  `x-amz-copy-source` and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an
  HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a
  version for the `x-amz-copy-source`.

  You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by
  adding the `versionId` subresource as shown in the following example:

  `x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id`

  ## Special Errors

    *     * *Code: NoSuchUpload*

      * *Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.
  The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted
  or completed.*

      * *HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found*

    *     * *Code: InvalidRequest*

  Passes transformed objects to a `GetObject` operation when using Object Lambda
  Access Points.

  For information about Object Lambda Access Points, see [Transforming objects with Object Lambda Access
  Points](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/transforming-objects.html)
  in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

  This operation supports metadata that can be returned by
  [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html), in addition to `RequestRoute`, `RequestToken`, `StatusCode`, `ErrorCode`, and
  `ErrorMessage`. The `GetObject` response metadata is supported so that the
  `WriteGetObjectResponse` caller, typically an AWS Lambda function, can provide
  the same metadata when it internally invokes `GetObject`. When
  `WriteGetObjectResponse` is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the
  metadata returned to the end user `GetObject` call might differ from what Amazon
  S3 would normally return.

  AWS provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object
  Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and
  decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the AWS
  Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the AWS
  Management Console when you create your Object Lambda Access Point.

  Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a
  natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find
  insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally
  identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card
  numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

  Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a
  natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find
  insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally
  identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card
  numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.

  Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is
  equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file
  formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.

  For information on how to view and use these functions, see [Using AWS built
  Lambda
