  Key Management Service

  Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service.

  This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
  general information about KMS, see the [ *Key Management Service Developer Guide* ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/).

  KMS is replacing the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *KMS key* and *KMS
  key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping
  some variations of this term.

  Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
  various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android,
  etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS
  and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks
  such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests
  automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
  including how to download and install them, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API
  calls to KMS.

  Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2.
  Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such
  as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman
  (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

  ## Signing Requests

  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We
  strongly recommend that you *do not* use your Amazon Web Services account (root)
  access key ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the access
  key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web
  Services Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that
  you can use to sign requests.

  All KMS operations require [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

  ## Logging API Requests

  KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and
  related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an
  Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by
  CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the
  request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including
  how to turn it on and find your log files, see the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

  ## Additional Resources

  ## Commonly Used API Operations

  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most
  useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than
  these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

  Connects or reconnects a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  to its associated CloudHSM cluster.

  The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key
  store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom
  key store at any time.

  To connect a custom key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at
  least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the
  [DescribeClusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeClusters.html) operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the
  [CreateHsm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHsm.html)
  operation. Also, the [ `kmsuser` crypto user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-store-concepts.html#concept-kmsuser)
  (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this
  account to log in.

  The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20
  minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for
  it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200
  response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not
  indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of
  the custom key store, use the `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation.

  During the connection process, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated
  with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to
  the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the `kmsuser` CU, and rotates its
  password.

  The `ConnectCustomKeyStore` operation might fail for various reasons. To find
  the reason, use the `DescribeCustomKeyStores` operation and see the
  `ConnectionErrorCode` in the response. For help interpreting the
  `ConnectionErrorCode`, see `CustomKeyStoresListEntry`.

  To fix the failure, use the `DisconnectCustomKeyStore` operation to disconnect
  the custom key store, correct the error, use the `UpdateCustomKeyStore`
  operation if necessary, and then use `ConnectCustomKeyStore` again.

  If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see
  [Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html)

  Creates a friendly name for a KMS key.

  Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the KMS
  key. For details, see [Using ABAC in KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/abac.html) in the
  *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  You can use an alias to identify a KMS key in the KMS console, in the
  `DescribeKey` operation and in [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations),
  such as `Encrypt` and `GenerateDataKey`. You can also change the KMS key that's
  associated with the alias (`UpdateAlias`) or delete the alias (`DeleteAlias`) at
  any time. These operations don't affect the underlying KMS key.

  You can associate the alias with any customer managed key in the same Amazon Web
  Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one KMS key at a time, but a
  KMS key can have multiple aliases. A valid KMS key is required. You can't create
  an alias without a KMS key.

  The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases
  with the same name in different Regions. For detailed information about aliases,
  see [Using aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created,
  use the `ListAliases` operation.

  Adds a grant to a KMS key.

  A *grant* is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to
  use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS
  key (`DescribeKey`) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a
  KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants
  are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its
  permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.

  For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see [Using grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html) in
  the * *Key Management Service Developer Guide* *. For examples of working with
  grants in several programming languages, see [Programming grants](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-grants.html).

  The `CreateGrant` operation returns a `GrantToken` and a `GrantId`.

    * When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief
  delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout
  KMS. This state is known as *eventual consistency*. Once the grant has achieved
  eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant
  without identifying the grant.

  However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the `GrantToken`
  that `CreateGrant` returns. For details, see [Using a grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#using-grant-token)
  in the * *Key Management Service Developer Guide* *.

    * The `CreateGrant` operation also returns a `GrantId`. You can use
  the `GrantId` and a key identifier to identify the grant in the `RetireGrant`
  and `RevokeGrant` operations. To find the grant ID, use the `ListGrants` or
  `ListRetirableGrants` operations.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  Creates a unique customer managed [KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#kms-keys)
  in your Amazon Web Services account and Region.

  KMS is replacing the term *customer master key (CMK)* with *KMS key* and *KMS
  key*. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping
  some variations of this term.

  You can use the `CreateKey` operation to create symmetric or asymmetric KMS
  keys.

    * **Symmetric KMS keys** contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never
  leaves KMS unencrypted. To use the KMS key, you must call KMS. You can use a
  symmetric KMS key to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are
  typically used to generate [data keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-keys)
  and [data keys pairs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#data-key-pairs).
  For details, see `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair`.

    * **Asymmetric KMS keys** can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic
  Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS
  unencrypted. However, you can use the `GetPublicKey` operation to download the
  public key so it can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA key pairs can be
  used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS
  keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.

  For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:

  ## Definitions

  ### Asymmetric KMS keys

  To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the `KeySpec` parameter to specify the type
  of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the `KeyUsage` parameter to determine
  whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You
  can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.

  ### Symmetric KMS keys

  When creating a symmetric KMS key, you don't need to specify the `KeySpec` or
  `KeyUsage` parameters. The default value for `KeySpec`, `SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT`, and
  the default value for `KeyUsage`, `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`, are the only valid values
  for symmetric KMS keys.

  ### Multi-Region primary keys

  ### Imported key material

  To create a multi-Region *primary key* in the local Amazon Web Services Region,
  use the `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of `True`. To create a multi-Region
  *replica key*, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a
  primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the
  `ReplicateKey` operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its
  primary key to a replica key, use the `UpdatePrimaryRegion` operation.

  This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets you create
  multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions.
  Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata,
  you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services
  Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without
  re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
  multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Region keys
  with imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key
  store.

  To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric KMS key with no
  key material. To do this, use the `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value
  of `EXTERNAL`. Next, use `GetParametersForImport` operation to get a public key
  and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use
  `ImportKeyMaterial` with your import token to import the key material. For
  step-by-step instructions, see [Importing Key Material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html)
  in the * *Key Management Service Developer Guide* *. You cannot import the key
  material into an asymmetric KMS key.

  To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the
  `Origin` parameter of `CreateKey` with a value of `EXTERNAL` and the
  `MultiRegion` parameter with a value of `True`. To create replicas of the
  multi-Region primary key, use the `ReplicateKey` operation. For more information
  about multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  ### Custom key store

  To create a symmetric KMS key in a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html),
  use the `CustomKeyStoreId` parameter to specify the custom key store. You must
  also use the `Origin` parameter with a value of `AWS_CLOUDHSM`. The CloudHSM
  cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two
  active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.

  You cannot create an asymmetric KMS key in a custom key store. For information
  about custom key stores in KMS see [Using Custom Key Stores](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  in the * *Key Management Service Developer Guide* *.

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a KMS key in
  a different Amazon Web Services account.

  **Required permissions**:
  [kms:CreateKey](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) (IAM policy). To use the `Tags` parameter,
  [kms:TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html)
  (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see [Allow a user to create KMS
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policy-example-create-key)

  Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a KMS key using any of the following
  operations:

    * `Encrypt`

    * `GenerateDataKey`

    * `GenerateDataKeyPair`

    * `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext`

    * `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext`

  You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a
  symmetric or asymmetric KMS key.

  When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and the encryption
  algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about
  symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of KMS
  by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt
  ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption
  SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/) or
  [Amazon S3 client-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html).
  These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS.

  If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the `KeyId` parameter
  is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the
  symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation
  by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was
  encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS
  key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the `KeyId` parameter
  to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext
  was encrypted under a different KMS key, the `Decrypt` operation fails. This
  practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.

  Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the
  `Decrypt` operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies.
  Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user `Decrypt`
  permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was
  encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account
  KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for `Decrypt` permissions,
  limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts. For
  details, see [Best practices for IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/iam-policies.html#iam-policies-best-practices)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Applications in Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves can call this operation by
  using the [Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-c). For information about the
  supporting parameters, see [How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves use KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-nitro-enclaves.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Because an alias is not a property of a KMS key, you can delete and change the
  aliases of a KMS key without affecting the KMS key. Also, aliases do not appear
  in the response from the `DescribeKey` operation. To get the aliases of all KMS
  keys, use the `ListAliases` operation.

  Each KMS key can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a KMS key, use
  `DeleteAlias` to delete the current alias and `CreateAlias` to create a new

  KMS keys in the key store for any [cryptographic operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations).
  Then, use `ScheduleKeyDeletion` to delete the KMS keys from the key store. When
  the scheduled waiting period expires, the `ScheduleKeyDeletion` operation
  deletes the KMS keys. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material
  from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key
  material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key)
  from the cluster and its backups.

  After all KMS keys are deleted from KMS, use `DisconnectCustomKeyStore` to
  disconnect the key store from KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store.

  Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using
  `DisconnectCustomKeyStore` to disconnect it from KMS. While the key store is
  disconnected, you cannot create or use the KMS keys in the key store. But, you
  do not need to delete KMS keys and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key
  store at any time.

  If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

  This operation is part of the [Custom Key Store feature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html)
  feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS
  with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

  Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a KMS key.

  The `Encrypt` operation has two primary use cases:

    * You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a
  personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.

    * You can use the `Encrypt` operation to move encrypted data from
  one Amazon Web Services Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a
  data key and use the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use
  the `Encrypt` operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a KMS key in
  Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to
  Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the
  encrypted data entirely within in Region B.

  You don't need to use the `Encrypt` operation to encrypt a data key. The
  `GenerateDataKey` and `GenerateDataKeyPair` operations return a plaintext data
  key and an encrypted copy of that data key.

  When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key to use
  in the encryption operation. The KMS key must have a `KeyUsage` value of
  `ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.` To find the `KeyUsage` of a KMS key, use the `DescribeKey`
  operation.

  If you use a symmetric KMS key, you can use an encryption context to add
  additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an
  `EncryptionContext` when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption
  context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the
  request to decrypt fails with an `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more
  information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  If you specify an asymmetric KMS key, you must also specify the encryption
  algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the KMS key type.

  When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to
  record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be
  required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
  the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt
  the data, the decrypt operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of KMS
  key and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

  ## How to use your data key

  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your
  application. You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption
  library, such as the [Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/), the
  [Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb-encryption-client/latest/devguide/),
  or [Amazon S3 client-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html)
  to do these tasks for you.

  To encrypt data outside of KMS:

    1. Use the `GenerateDataKey` operation to get a data key.

    2. Use the plaintext data key (in the `Plaintext` field of the
  response) to encrypt your data outside of KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key
  from memory.

    3. Store the encrypted data key (in the `CiphertextBlob` field of
  the response) with the encrypted data.

  To decrypt data outside of KMS:

    1. Use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted data key.
  The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.

    2. Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data outside of KMS, then
  erase the plaintext data key from memory.

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a
  different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the

  Generates a unique asymmetric data key pair.

  The `GenerateDataKeyPair` operation returns a plaintext public key, a plaintext
  private key, and a copy of the private key that is encrypted under the symmetric
  KMS key you specify. You can use the data key pair to perform asymmetric
  cryptography and implement digital signatures outside of KMS.

  You can use the public key that `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns to encrypt data or
  verify a signature outside of KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key with
  the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message, you can use the
  `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted private key.

  To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric KMS key to encrypt the
  private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS
  key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the
  `DescribeKey` operation.

  Use the `KeyPairSpec` parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data
  key pair. KMS recommends that your use ECC key pairs for signing, and use RSA
  key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. However, KMS cannot
  enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS.

  If you are using the data key pair to encrypt data, or for any operation where
  you don't immediately need a private key, consider using the
  `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext` operation.
  `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext` returns a plaintext public key and an
  encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need only to
  decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the data
  or sign a message, use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted private
  key in the data key pair.

  `GenerateDataKeyPair` returns a unique data key pair for each request. The bytes
  in the keys are not related to the caller or the KMS key that is used to encrypt
  the private key. The public key is a DER-encoded X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as
  specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). The private key is a DER-encoded PKCS8 PrivateKeyInfo, as specified in [RFC
  5958](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5958).

  You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the
  encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`, you must specify
  the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the
  encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an
  `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)

  private key with the data. When you are ready to decrypt data or sign a message,
  you can use the `Decrypt` operation to decrypt the encrypted private key.

  To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric KMS key to encrypt the
  private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key or a KMS
  key in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your KMS key, use the
  `DescribeKey` operation.

  Use the `KeyPairSpec` parameter to choose an RSA or Elliptic Curve (ECC) data
  key pair. KMS recommends that your use ECC key pairs for signing, and use RSA
  key pairs for either encryption or signing, but not both. However, KMS cannot
  enforce any restrictions on the use of data key pairs outside of KMS.

  `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext` returns a unique data key pair for each
  request. The bytes in the key are not related to the caller or KMS key that is
  used to encrypt the private key. The public key is a DER-encoded X.509
  SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280).

  You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the
  encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`, you must specify
  the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the
  encrypted data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an
  `InvalidCiphertextException`. For more information, see [Encryption Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  Generates a unique symmetric data key.

  This operation returns a data key that is encrypted under a KMS key that you
  specify. To request an asymmetric data key pair, use the `GenerateDataKeyPair`
  or `GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext` operations.

  `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext` is identical to the `GenerateDataKey`
  operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This
  operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not
  immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the `Decrypt` operation
  on the encrypted copy of the key.

  It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For
  example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your
  system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each
  container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That
  component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt
  data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the
  plaintext data key. In this system, the component that creates the containers
  never sees the plaintext data key.

  `GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext` returns a unique data key for each request.
  The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or KMS key that is used to
  encrypt the private key.

  To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric KMS key that is used to
  encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric KMS key to generate a data
  key. To get the type of your KMS key, use the `DescribeKey` operation.

  If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in
  the `CiphertextBlob` field.

  You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the
  encryption operation. If you specify an `EncryptionContext`, you must specify
  the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the

  Returns the public key of an asymmetric KMS key.

  Unlike the private key of a asymmetric KMS key, which never leaves KMS
  unencrypted, callers with `kms:GetPublicKey` permission can download the public
  key of an asymmetric KMS key. You can share the public key to allow others to
  encrypt messages and verify signatures outside of KMS. For information about
  symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key
  within KMS by calling the `Encrypt`, `ReEncrypt`, or `Verify` operations with
  the identifier of an asymmetric KMS key. When you use the public key within KMS,
  you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of
  every KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be
  decrypted. These features are not effective outside of KMS. For details, see
  [Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations).

  To help you use the public key safely outside of KMS, `GetPublicKey` returns
  important information about the public key in the response, including:

    *
  [KeySpec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeySpec): The type of key material in the public key, such as `RSA_4096` or
  `ECC_NIST_P521`.

    *
  [KeyUsage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-KeyUsage):
  Whether the key is used for encryption or signing.

    *
  [EncryptionAlgorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-EncryptionAlgorithms) or
  [SigningAlgorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GetPublicKey.html#KMS-GetPublicKey-response-SigningAlgorithms):
  A list of the encryption algorithms or the signing algorithms for the key.

  Although KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is
  crucial that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used
  improperly. For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used
  encrypt data, or prevent a public key from being used with an encryption
  algorithm that is not supported by KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using
  the wrong signing algorithm in a verification operation.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

  material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/importing-keys.html#reimport-key-material)
  into that KMS key, but you cannot import different key material.

  You cannot perform this operation on an asymmetric KMS key or on any KMS key in

  Before using this operation, call `GetParametersForImport`. Its response
  includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key
  material. Then, submit the import token from the same `GetParametersForImport`
  response.

  When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:

    * The key ID or key ARN of a KMS key with no key material. Its
  `Origin` must be `EXTERNAL`.

  To create a KMS key with no key material, call `CreateKey` and set the value of
  its `Origin` parameter to `EXTERNAL`. To get the `Origin` of a KMS key, call
  `DescribeKey`.)

    * The encrypted key material. To get the public key to encrypt the
  key material, call `GetParametersForImport`.

    * The import token that `GetParametersForImport` returned. You must
  use a public key and token from the same `GetParametersForImport` response.

    * Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an
  expiration date, KMS deletes the key material from the KMS key on the specified
  date, and the KMS key becomes unusable. To use the KMS key again, you must
  reimport the same key material. The only way to change an expiration date is by
  reimporting the same key material and specifying a new expiration date.

  When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes from
  `PendingImport` to `Enabled`, and you can use the KMS key.

  If this operation fails, use the exception to help determine the problem. If the
  error is related to the key material, the import token, or wrapping key, use
  `GetParametersForImport` to get a new public key and import token for the KMS

  ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This
  information is required to decrypt the data.

    * If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the
  `SourceKeyId` parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata
  that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to
  your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext
  decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID.
  However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice.
  When you use the `SourceKeyId` parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the
  KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key,
  the `ReEncrypt` operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key
  that you intend.

    * To reencrypt the data, you must use the `DestinationKeyId`
  parameter specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted.
  You can select a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key. If the destination KMS key is
  an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The
  algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.

  When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to
  record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be
  required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
  the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt
  the data, the decrypt operation fails.

  You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you
  decrypt with symmetric KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the
  ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with
  asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not
  include configurable fields.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.
  For details, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in
  the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. The source KMS key and destination KMS key can be in
  different Amazon Web Services accounts. Either or both KMS keys can be in a
  different account than the caller. To specify a KMS key in a different account,
  you must use its key ARN or alias ARN.

  **Required permissions**:

    *
  [kms:ReEncryptFrom](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html) permission on the source KMS key (key policy)

    *

  To permit reencryption from or to a KMS key, include the `"kms:ReEncrypt*"`

  This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use the

  Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region.

  This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region
  primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You
  can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different
  Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the `CreateKey` operation.

  This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets you create
  multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions.
  Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata,
  you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services
  Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without
  re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
  multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  A *replica key* is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of
  its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share
  properties that make them interoperable. They have the same [key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id)
  and key material. They also have the same [key spec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec),
  [key usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage),
  [key material origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin),
  and [automatic key rotation status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html).
  KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related
  multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including
  its [key policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html),
  [tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/tagging-keys.html), [aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-alias.html),
  and [key state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html).
  KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.

  When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of
  `Creating`. This key state changes to `Enabled` (or `PendingImport`) after a few
  seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the
  key state is `Creating`, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in
  cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key
  programmatically, retry on `KMSInvalidStateException` or call `DescribeKey` to
  check its `KeyState` value before using it. For details about the `Creating` key
  state, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *Key Management Service
  Developer Guide*.

  The CloudTrail log of a `ReplicateKey` operation records a `ReplicateKey`
  operation in the primary key's Region and a `CreateKey` operation in the replica
  key's Region.

  If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the
  replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key
  material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see [Importing key material into multi-Region
  keys](kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-import.html) in the *Key
  Management Service Developer Guide*.

  To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the `UpdatePrimaryRegion`
  operation.

  `ReplicateKey` uses different default values for the `KeyPolicy` and `Tags`
  parameters than those used in the KMS console. For details, see the parameter
  descriptions.

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation to create a replica key
  in a different Amazon Web Services account.

  **Required permissions**:

    * `kms:ReplicateKey` on the primary key (in the primary key's
  Region). Include this permission in the primary key's key policy.

  Deletes a grant.

  Typically, you retire a grant when you no longer need its permissions. To
  identify the grant to retire, use a [grant token](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token),
  or both the grant ID and a key identifier (key ID or key ARN) of the KMS key.
  The `CreateGrant` operation returns both values.

  This operation can be called by the *retiring principal* for a grant, by the
  *grantee principal* if the grant allows the `RetireGrant` operation, and by the
  Amazon Web Services account (root user) in which the grant is created. It can

  Schedules the deletion of a KMS key.

  By default, KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, but you can specify a
  waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state of
  the KMS key changes to `PendingDeletion` and the key can't be used in any
  cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the
  waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use `CancelKeyDeletion`
  to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS
  deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it,
  including all aliases that refer to it.

  Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a
  KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is
  unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.) To prevent
  the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use `DisableKey`.

  If you schedule deletion of a KMS key from a [custom key store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/custom-key-store-overview.html),
  when the waiting period expires, `ScheduleKeyDeletion` deletes the KMS key from
  KMS. Then KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated
  CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually [delete the orphaned key material](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/fix-keystore.html#fix-keystore-orphaned-key)
  from the cluster and its backups.

  You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys
  at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with
  existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with
  replicas, its key state changes to `PendingReplicaDeletion` and it cannot be
  replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue
  indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just
  scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to `PendingDeletion` and
  its waiting period (`PendingWindowInDays`) begins. For details, see [Deleting multi-Region
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-delete.html)

  Creates a [digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) for a message or message digest by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS
  key.

  To verify the signature, use the `Verify` operation, or use the public key in
  the same asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about symmetric and
  asymmetric KMS keys, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such
  as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key
  owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone
  with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular
  private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.

  To use the `Sign` operation, provide the following information:

    * Use the `KeyId` parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a
  `KeyUsage` value of `SIGN_VERIFY`. To get the `KeyUsage` value of a KMS key, use
  the `DescribeKey` operation. The caller must have `kms:Sign` permission on the
  KMS key.

    * Use the `Message` parameter to specify the message or message
  digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger
  message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest
  in the `Message` parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or
  a digest, use the `MessageType` parameter.

    * Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.

  When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing algorithm.
  This information is required to verify the signature.

  To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the `Verify`
  operation. Or use the `GetPublicKey` operation to download the public key and
  then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS.

  key is now the key in `eu-west-2`, and the key in `us-east-1` becomes a replica
  key. For details, see [Updating the primary Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-manage.html#multi-region-update)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  This operation supports *multi-Region keys*, an KMS feature that lets you create
  multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions.
  Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata,
  you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services
  Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without
  re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about
  multi-Region keys, see [Using multi-Region keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  The *primary key* of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are
  always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key material, [key ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id),
  [key spec](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-spec),
  [key usage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-usage),
  [key material origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-origin),
  and [automatic key rotation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/rotate-keys.html).
  It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot [delete the primary key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduleKeyDeletion.html)
  until all replica keys are deleted.

  The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key
  that will become the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica
  key. This operation does not create a KMS key in the specified Region. To find
  the replica keys, use the `DescribeKey` operation on the primary key or any
  replica key. To create a replica key, use the `ReplicateKey` operation.

  You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys in
  cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause
  failures in cryptographic operations.

  Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region
  might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as
  `DescribeKey` might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The
  old and new primary keys have a transient key state of `Updating`. The original
  key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is
  `Updating`, you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot
  replicate the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as
  enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the `Updating` key state,
  see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in the *Key Management Service
  Developer Guide*.

  This operation does not return any output. To verify that primary key is
  changed, use the `DescribeKey` operation.

  **Cross-account use**: No. You cannot use this operation in a different Amazon
  Web Services account.

  **Required permissions**:

    * `kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion` on the current primary key (in the
  primary key's Region). Include this permission primary key's key policy.

    * `kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion` on the current replica key (in the
  replica key's Region). Include this permission in the replica key's key policy.

  Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the `Sign` operation.

  Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the
  specified KMS key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it
  was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the `SignatureValid`
  field in the response is `True`. If the signature verification fails, the
  `Verify` operation fails with an `KMSInvalidSignatureException` exception.

  A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS
  key. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric
  KMS key. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see [Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS
  keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
  in the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  To verify a digital signature, you can use the `Verify` operation. Specify the
  same asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing algorithm that were used to
  produce the signature.

  You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the KMS key
  outside of KMS. Use the `GetPublicKey` operation to download the public key in
  the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key to verify the signature
  outside of KMS. The advantage of using the `Verify` operation is that it is
  performed within KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed
  within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy
  and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify
  signatures.

  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.
  For details, see [Key state: Effect on your KMS key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html) in
  the *Key Management Service Developer Guide*.

  **Cross-account use**: Yes. To perform this operation with a KMS key in a
  different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the
