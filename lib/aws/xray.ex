  Uploads segment documents to AWS X-Ray. The [X-Ray
  SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html) generates segment
  documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which uploads them in
  batches. A segment document can be a completed segment, an in-progress
  segment, or an array of subsegments.

  Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document
  schema, see [AWS X-Ray Segment
  Documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html)
  in the *AWS X-Ray Developer Guide*.

  <p class="title"> **Required segment document fields**

  <ul> <li> `name` - The name of the service that handled the request.

  </li> <li> `id` - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among
  segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.

  </li> <li> `trace_id` - A unique identifier that connects all segments and
  subsegments originating from a single client request.

  </li> <li> `start_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in
  floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For
  example, `1480615200.010` or `1.480615200010E9`.

  </li> <li> `end_time` - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For
  example, `1480615200.090` or `1.480615200090E9`. Specify either an
  `end_time` or `in_progress`.

  </li> <li> `in_progress` - Set to `true` instead of specifying an
  `end_time` to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete.
  Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that
  will take a long time to serve, to trace that the request was received.
  When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the
  in-progress segment.

  </li> </ul> A `trace_id` consists of three numbers separated by hyphens.
  For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:

  <p class="title"> **Trace ID Format**

  <ul> <li> The version number, for instance, `1`.

  </li> <li> The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8
  hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch
  time is `1480615200` seconds, or `58406520` in hexadecimal.

  </li> <li> A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24
  hexadecimal digits.
