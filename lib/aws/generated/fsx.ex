  Copies an existing backup within the same AWS account to another Region
  (cross-Region copy) or within the same Region (in-Region copy).

  You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination
  Region per account.

  You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-region disaster recovery. You
  periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event
  of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover
  availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only
  within your AWS partition.

  You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or
  within the same Region.

  You can use the `SourceRegion` parameter to specify the AWS Region from which
  the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the
  `us-west-1` Region and want to copy a backup from the `us-east-2` Region, you
  specify `us-east-2` in the `SourceRegion` parameter to make a cross-Region copy.
  If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region
  where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

  For more information on creating backup copies, see [ Copying backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html#copy-backups)

  Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system.

  Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you
  to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file
  system.

  For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file
  systems with the following configuration:

    * a Persistent deployment type

    * is *not* linked to a data respository.

  For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see
  [Working with FSx for Lustre backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html).

  For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Windows file systems, see
  [Working with FSx for Windows backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/using-backups.html).

  If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters
  match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a
  backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match,
  this operation returns `IncompatibleParameterError`. If a backup with the
  specified client request token doesn't exist, `CreateBackup` does the following:

    * Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an
  initial lifecycle state of `CREATING`.

    * Returns the description of the backup.

  By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a `CreateBackup` operation
  without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when
  an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was
  created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a
  backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are
  the same.

  The `CreateBackup` operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still
  `CREATING`. You can check the backup creation status by calling the
  `DescribeBackups` operation, which returns the backup state along with other
  information.
